 Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @PERSON1 or @PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet @CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of "Which @CAPS4 ruled @CAPS5, who they came from, and @CAPS5 they're other names were". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes "@CAPS5 about @CAPS6?!". Her intentions were about the @CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard "@CAPS5 about @CAPS9 @CAPS10?!", until we paused for a second and processed @CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.

 The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, "live simply, so that others can simply live." I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. "@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea." @PERSON2 whispered over to me. "@CAPS4?" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. "I had nothing to do with this." I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. "@CAPS5 is going to kill you." I gasped. "@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious." @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. "@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. "@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. "@CAPS9 fast." @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever.

 It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear "@CAPS1!" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and i enjoyed my party.

 What would you do in a world with @CAPS4 laughter? Everyday everyone smiles or laughs. It makes a person feel better. Laughing is a healthy drug it affects you and other people for the best. There are many times in my life where all I needed was to laugh. All I wanted was to have someone there to make me smile and bring up my spirits. I have an example. I just moved again it was my @NUM1 high school. I felt totally alone I knew nobody, and nobody was there to help me feel less alone. I wanted a friendly face to smile at me, or talk to me. The whole @NUM2 hours at this new school was dreadful. When waiting for my mom to come get me I was hating my new life here. "@CAPS1 @CAPS4 one talked to me on the first day, then @CAPS4 one will talk to me at all" is what kept passing through my mind. I remembered everyday after school walking home with my group of friends, we would all tease each other, or just say something stupid. We were always laughing and happy. As I was sitting there waiting for my mom, I heard my name being called by a familiar voice. As I looked up I found my friends @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 sticking their heads out my moms car window waving at me. Seeing how school just barely got out there were tons of teenagers still @NUM3, @PERSON2, @PERSON6!!" I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts disappeared and I was smiling. I could feel people starring at me as my friends got out of the car to give me a hug. For some reason I didn't care all I cared about was being able to smile again, and be truly happy with my closest friends. I grabbed my purse and ran over to them to give them all hugs. They missed two classes to come pick me up from school. My mom told them how unhappy I was, and that what I needed was a friendly face. She couldn't have been more right. After hugs, smiles, and laughs were exchanged my friend @PERSON5 said his classic line."@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @PERSON3?" @CAPS4 one could help but laugh even my mom broke a smile. When getting in the car I forgot all about my bad day and how horrible I felt. I forgot about how badly I wanted my friends there to make me feel me. When they actually came I couldn't have been more happier. My life felt great, school after that was great. I made great friends there because my three buddies reminded me who I was, and pushed me to be me. They made me laugh and when I smiled at my new high school people were more open and welcoming to me. It wasn't long after that I @PERSON4 was able to go to school with a smile and laugh everyday. Friends have a great influence in your life they remind you to smile and how great a laugh is. Laughing is the truth between happiness I would have to say. It was because of me smiling and laughing that I made new friends and had another great high school life. Laughing brought people to me because it made me seem like a friendly fun person that I am. I see laughing being the cure to all unhappiness.

@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an I'm a @ORGANIZATION1" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you." @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world."

 When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.

 It all started with a book @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. My mom had noticed I was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. I had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm not sure today what my mom saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. In @DATE2, in my new house I first met @PERSON1. That evening before she arrived I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances I had she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly I retreated to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON1 first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did. "@CAPS1, what are you reading?" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. Come look for yourself." I replied offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @PERSON1 looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @DATE1 short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In that smile I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. As the new, cool @DATE3 air began to rush through the opened door I reached out to hug her. To my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. Once she was gone for the night I began to think. I really liked @PERSON1 and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE1, and we are the closest friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE1 for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to laughter excelling conversation @DATE1 @DATE1 ago, I have had the best experience I could of ever asked for.

  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS1 gave me up for adaption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, @CAPS1 wasn't ready @CAPS8 be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS4 her. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS2 we were at @PERSON1's house in the @DATE1 or @DATE2 we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON1 @CAPS3 her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away, @PERSON1 and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS4 @PERSON2. That when we saw each other @CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS8 my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON1 and I got the chance @CAPS8 talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS8.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS4 @PERSON2 an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS8 go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS6 was then that i relized @PERSON1 had tought me something else @CAPS8 appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS4 sorrow. @CAPS8 rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS8 have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS8 everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS6 credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS4 me.
<START>

Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't "click" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, "@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? ". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done. We are true friends.

 Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS6 keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS10 those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS8 laugh because @CAPS8 hear it. Those @CAPS10 my favorite. Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS8 here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME1 confession or horror at the "would @CAPS8 rather?" someone just came up with. One @TIME1 in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE1 and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME1, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, "@CAPS1 guys, hows life?" We all @CAPS16 because if @CAPS8 @CAPS10 around @PERSON3 for more than and hour @CAPS8 will here this saying a @CAPS2 times.  "@CAPS3 as five minutes ago," I replied.  "@CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed," said @PERSON1 sarcastically. "@CAPS5 really?" @LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, "@CAPS6 have @CAPS8 had a personality flip, @CAPS11 @CAPS8'@CAPS20 now blond and stupid?"  "@CAPS7." @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of "the brain"being stupid.  "@CAPS8 guys want to play would @CAPS8 rather?" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. "@CAPS9!" yelled @PERSON2, "I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. "@CAPS10 @CAPS8 sure? I have some new ones." @PERSON1 said with her best evil voice, "@CAPS11 would @CAPS8 rather have to..." "@CAPS9!" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  "@CAPS13 or @CAPS14?" @PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION2's pillow. "@CAPS6 did @CAPS8 say?" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. "I'@CAPS23 too lazy, and unless the @CAPS14 is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS23 not playing!" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  "I agree," @LOCATION1 added, "I'@CAPS23 too lazy."  "@LOCATION1 it would take @CAPS8 four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS8'@CAPS20 so @CAPS21." @CAPS16 @PERSON1. "@PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 not @CAPS21. I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!"  "@CAPS5 just accept it @LOCATION1, @CAPS8'@CAPS20 @CAPS21!" "@CAPS9 @PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!"We continued @CAPS11 this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME1 air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE1, @CAPS9 school, @CAPS9 stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME1 sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends.

 One day, a day before the party for my brother's @DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin @PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be @PERSON5 , @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. @PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the @DATE1 boy. The boy's were suppose to be cleaning the apartment but their boy's and the only things on theirs minds are girls and video games. They played video games instead of cleaning and mom got mad. Lucky for them mom was in a very good mood or they would have got @CAPS7. The last to boy's showed up now.   The last two boy's showed up and their names are @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow after noon. @PERSON6 was so exited that he was turning @NUM1 years old , he said " I'm @NUM1 years old now no one can tell me what to do" and I laughed and said "@PERSON6 go make me a sandwich" and he said "@CAPS3" and I said "so much for no one can tell me what to do" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boy's went to the apartment to clean @CAPS7 but when I got in there they set up @PERSON5's x-box @NUM3 and was playing @CAPS7. I told them to get cleaning but they decided not to listen so I got mom and they sure listened to her. She took @CAPS7 and put @CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They were not happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-bow back. @TIME1 all of us were watching movies and playing broad games then mom told @PERSON4 and I to clean my room , maybe a hour after that she walked by and said " bed time" and boy's go to the apartment. The next mourning.  The next mourning @PERSON4 and I woke up to the sun hitting us in the eyes and I said "what a great way to start off the day" and @PERSON4 said "I know". The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When @PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @TIME1 that @TIME1 the boy's thought @CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. @PERSON2 , @CAPS2 , @PERSON6 were the cops and @PERSON5 and @CAPS1 were the rubbers. @PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into @PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the @TIME1. Mom told @PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said "yes". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so @PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs @PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said "good mourning beautiful" and I said "good mourning to you to baby". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister @CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said "ma'am I want a cookie" and mom said " okay , here you go baby". @CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. @PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said "wow" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. @CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of @CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and @PERSON6 said " @CAPS7 was his most favorite @DATE1 he's ever had so far . @CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and @PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I. Sometimes you got to work with what you got and @CAPS7 might turn out more fun than your normal plan you made. Just make sure your happy with the people around you.

                                        The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4                                          @CAPS5 @PERSON1 is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like "mommy, I can't find my shirt" @CAPS6 would tell me, "@PERSON1 @CAPS21 just threw it on the ground", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS6 would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah @CAPS21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love @CAPS21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS21 move on.  There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS7, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS8 theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually @CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I @MONTH1 be stuck with the nickname @CAPS8 for the rest of my life. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who @CAPS5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS10, @CAPS6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS6 does its a little thing called @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on @PERSON2's face; @CAPS21 could say it was classic.  As I advanced in my @CAPS16 years moving into @CAPS15 @CAPS16, I joined an organization; the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 of the @CAPS19 for @CAPS20, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS1 at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.  @CAPS19 has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS21, its okay to love anyone @CAPS21 want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a @CAPS1 thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.  I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS21 lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS21 and your friends can get a @CAPS1 laugh every once in a while. Thank @CAPS21.

                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said " @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous "@CAPS5, kinda" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said "hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!"@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said "I do not know actually"while she dug in her bag, "but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put." "@CAPS8" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said "@CAPS9 I am!" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said "@CAPS10 did I scare you?" in an little school girl voice, and he replied "@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared." I just rolled my eyes and him and said "I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted "@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said "@CAPS16 this is interesting" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us "@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!" and I said "@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said "@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked "@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied "@CAPS24's a long story". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend.
<START>

 Somewhere along the road a guy once said "a laugh a day keeps the doctor away." @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking "yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. "We have to break up" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously.
<START>

 Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like "@CAPS1 WAS THAT"?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. "@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want"? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. "@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know"? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about.

 Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. I'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. In other words, I'm a teachers worst nightmare.  Ring....ring....ring, time for @CAPS1. It was a beautiful afternoon and I was feeling great! When I walked into the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. But I ignored it and went on with what I normally do, which is get out my @CAPS2 and crank up the tunes. I like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. When I listen to music I have those moments when I feel like I'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. It's almost like I'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until I start laughing that is. Finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point I was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. He looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't exactly pay much attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  About five minutes later my friend @PERSON1 comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music, I have a tendency to talk loud because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when I wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why I was talking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant I was given a warning). I turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @NUM1 my laughter is out, I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. "@CAPS3! You owe me thirty minutes of detention!" said my teacher. One of the biggest problems that I have is I'm very easily amused, I laugh at mainly everything and anything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so I began to laugh even harder.  When I start laughing, my friend @PERSON1 usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! One week later, @PERSON1 and I arrived in good old detention with all the other "rebels" (that's what I call myself now) it makes me feel tough. The thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. What do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.  "@CAPS4's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!" That motto is what I try to live by everyday. I feel like laughing is a very important part in my @CAPS4, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. Even though I @MONTH1 get in trouble from laughing, I don't regret it one bit. Some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. Laughing releases tension and for me I feel like it brings me closer to my friends. I love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!Live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you.

How Laughter @CAPS1 Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer(tracked loader) at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be @CAPS2 through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. "@CAPS2 mom" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out. My brother, @PERSON1 still hadn't come down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @CAPS2 he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks @CAPS2 missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him @CAPS2 his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that i could and went back to the house. It was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg @CAPS2 we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents house. I had a lot of trouble falling a sleep that night though. The next morning was @DATE1 so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot @CAPS2 i did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing house work and having to do it all the time was vary boring. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things went somewhat back to normal.  My brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter @CAPS1.

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.

 Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter @MONTH1 even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter @MONTH1 not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in @LOCATION1 years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to fin d the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.

@CAPS1 up kids my mother said as she was scrambling to get her stuff packed and ready.I knew exactly what i did wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. I set it for six pm and now we are late. Thinking to my self I hurried to get my clothes packed for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door realizing now that it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as girls they take for ever putting on there makeup and and straightening their hair.Finally everyone is packed, but it was now seven am and we were supposed to be to @LOCATION2 by now and were still sitting here at our house. As my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to @LOCATION3. We as a family have been planning @CAPS2 for a month and now it's @DATE2! I was really exited to go. By @CAPS2 point I had butterfly's in my stomach.We lived in @LOCATION1, we were only half way through @LOCATION2 with eight out of ten hours left to get to my mom's cousins house. I feel asleep for the first two hours of the ride and I can no longer sleep. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do. so I started to sing the never ending song. @CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends." @CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started laughing harder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter.My older sister now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so hard to get us to shut up. She was throwing her arms into the air and screaming one last time to shut up and threw herself back into her seat with a very nasty look of disgust on her face.over the next minute we all stopped laughing and was quiet for the next hour @CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands.I very soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most awkward of positions you could ever find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other in between the driver and passenger seats.I thought I was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my mom's cousins house. We were in the middle west of @LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swinging in the wind, squirrels moving about from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been away from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family.My stay in @LOCATION3 was a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid around the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us all to get out of @LOCATION1 for a weekend. She had not seen her cousin in about three years and was very happy to see her.It was now @DATE1 was time to get back to our normal lives, so we packed up our stuff and were headed back to our home. I was doing amazing at not talking and making my sister mad for the first minute or so. @CAPS3 I started to sing the never ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life. "

 The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it @MONTH1 also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I @MONTH1 have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which @MONTH1 have possibly been around in @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We @MONTH1 not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.

While living in @LOCATION5 I met the two people, whom are now my best friends, @PERSON1 @CAPS14 @CAPS1 @PERSON6. I met them both in entirely different ways. @PERSON1 threw school, @CAPS14 @CAPS1 threw paintball.  I met @PERSON1 when she moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base that was close to where I lived. We had two classes @CAPS14 lunch together. At first her @CAPS14 I didn't really talk much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @PERSON3, brought her to sit with us during lunch. Our friend @PERSON4 was overly hyper that day @CAPS14 ended up falling backwards in his chair @CAPS14 scaring some girls who'd been walking by at the time. We laughed so hard our faces went cherry red. After lunch we had class together, so we walked together @CAPS14 talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @CAPS3. We could not stop talking to save our lives. Luckily it was a free sketch day, for had it not have been we might have been in some trouble. After about a week had gone by @PERSON1 @CAPS14 I found out we had so much in common, it seemed almost unreal. Never had I met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I actually enjoyed hanging out with every day. She'd make faces @CAPS14 tell me stories about her past that would make me just bust out laughing. We talk almost every other day threw the internet, @CAPS14 even though she's over @NUM1 miles away, she can still make my stomach hurt from all the laughing. As for @CAPS1, he grew up in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5, then later on moved to @LOCATION4. We met while my dad, brother, @CAPS14 I went paint balling at a place called "The @CAPS5". It was a slow day. Not as many people were at the fields as normal, @CAPS6 some how there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys whom I found out on were @CAPS7 friends, @CAPS8 @CAPS14 @CAPS9. As it got later in the day @CAPS1 @CAPS14 a few other friends, @PERSON5 @CAPS14 @PERSON2, arrived. The games got a bit more interesting, but still not one person had been able to shoot me out before the referee called time. I was starting to get irritated with the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paint @CAPS14 heard a splat. I'd taken shots to the leg, mask, @CAPS14 trigger finger. When the game was over I spotted the guy who'd got me out. That person being @CAPS1. I ran over to him @CAPS14 said "@CAPS12 @CAPS13". He laughed @CAPS14 said "that wasn't luck, I chose get you out". I asked "well then why haven't you got me out before? huh? You know that was so totally a @CAPS12 @CAPS13". He returned with "I was just going easy on you, I didn't wanna make you feel bad". By then I had a smile on my face @CAPS14 a giggle in my voice "sure, that's why". We continued to joke about the game, @CAPS14 the people who were playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his e-mail on a small torn piece of cardboard, @CAPS14 asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an e-mail saying "I still think it was a @CAPS12 @CAPS13". Ever since that day we've been best friends. Still in almost every conversation one of us @CAPS8 mention the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @CAPS14 it makes us laugh every time. Though I don't get to see my best friends every day, We still make each other laugh long distance. It's just that now I get to spread the laughter to new people, @CAPS14 hopefully I'll get to make more wonderful friends like the two I've already discovered.

               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. "this looks like that!", or "she sounds like this!" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete.
<START>

 One day is was almost @CAPS1 and my sister, my mom, and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. Once my mom left my sister and I were still busy working away in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Finally she was done with making the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms ( little lemon glazed cakes). The directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice. @CAPS4 i told my sister to get the lemon juice out of the lemons. At this point in time I am making the little cakes, my sister yells at me and asks " do I just squeeze @CAPS3?" and I thinking she cut @CAPS3 says yes. Well I was wrong my sister yells at me again and says " @CAPS3 isn't working." @CAPS4 i turn around to find her squeezing an un-cut lemon trying to get the lemon juice out of @CAPS3 I just looked at her told her she needed to cut @CAPS3 and started laughing. I don't think I have ever laughed that hard. As I am on the floor crying because I am laughing @CAPS4 hard my mom comes into the kitchen with a bag full of grocery's and the first words out of her mouth were " @CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do." @CAPS7 if you can believe @CAPS3 i started laughing even harder. Also my sister to this day is still called lemons. This is because my family and I thought @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 funny that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience i have learned that laughing is important in @CAPS4 many ways, @CAPS3 can bring friends and family closer together, @CAPS3 can make any relationship stronger. This experience in the end made my sister and I a lot closer in many ways and now we always laugh together and I would rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I since this incident have become @CAPS4 much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should laugh because you might not know that laughing over the stupidest thing could make any relationship better and make the two people closer. @CAPS4 live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh could help you become friends with someone or bring you and someone closer than ever.

 After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. after much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life!It was so rich my mom and I could barley finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab.  We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again(which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and i caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I new one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess its not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake.

The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is.

  Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part in life. There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.

The @CAPS1 of Laughter.  Laughing is a huge part of most everyday life. It is a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it be from something as simple as a funny face, a joke, a picture, and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of people. @CAPS4 friends and I laugh constantly. We can make something funny out of pretty much anything. I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic.  I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of @CAPS4 friend @LOCATION1. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in @CAPS4 entire life. Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does @MONTH1 not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @LOCATION1 on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minuets straight. During practice our @CAPS3 had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five @CAPS2. @LOCATION1 not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, "@CAPS3, so do we @CAPS2 serve to spots one and five?" @CAPS4 whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. @LOCATION1 who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, @LOCATION1 decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. @CAPS5 agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in @LOCATION1's face, and all of a sudden they were no where to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, @CAPS2 to find @LOCATION1 face down on the ground with @CAPS5 sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @LOCATION1 and I being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get irritated with each other, or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that is something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can bring @CAPS1 so someones day, and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have on even the grumpiest of people.

 Many people think that @ORGANIZATION1 is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION1. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, "@CAPS3 we go!". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION1 is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!

 Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS1. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION1's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE1 day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE1, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS1, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly. It's always fun to spend time with family, but it'll be even better if you spend the time in a fun, exciting way! Make things fun, keep a positive, enjoyable outlook on everything!

 Laughter can not only be a benefit to ourselves but to others as well. We only seem to use it whenever you feel the need to become happy, but in reality it shouldn't be the only reason why. Laughter is not only being able to feel better but to let out what you need to let out. Being able to enjoy yourself is pride and you should feel better about yourself. Whenever you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is lifted off of your shoulders and you feel better about yourself? I don't mean you have to laugh so loud and so much that you fall off your chair and roll around but a simple chuckle would do the trick. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you are laughing you will and should feel better about yourself. That brings us to what happens around @CAPS2 family.  When I was younger I would go on trips with @CAPS2 family up to @LOCATION2. At the time I lived in @LOCATION1. Every @DATE1 we would cram anywhere from five to nine people in a van and be on our way. Having hardly any space of your own you would think it wouldn't be any fun. All in all we would have some fights about where to stop on the way from food or when to turn but nothing too serious. Being younger then everybody I was wildly bored. So to fix the problem I would make @CAPS2 family tell jokes, make funny faces, do something. Right when somebody would let out a joke or made a face, I would crack up laughing. Pure bliss and pure innocent. It didn't mean that they were funny or that they were even trying but to let up the intense shoulders, I would laugh. When we would get to where we were staying on @CAPS2 great grandparents land, we would cram yet another time, in a small area for our sleeping. Everybody would get a cot and would have to endure the warm daylight and the harsh cold bitter @TIME1. The cold nights were the ones that got to all of us the most, because @CAPS2 great grandparents had land meant that the place we were to stay at wasn't filtering heat. Sleeping bag and the clothes on your back were the only thing that we were able to get. So when the sun slipped slowly from shinning its bright light among us, we'd bundle up. Knowing me I did not listen to what @CAPS2 family sad and I would drink tons of water before I rest @CAPS2 head against the cot.  If you have common sense, which when I was younger did not. You would know that if you drink a lot before you go to bed and having the cold surround your body, you would have to use the restroom at some point during the @TIME1. Because @CAPS2 aunt was only @NUM1 years older then me, should would be the one that would have to wake up to walk me outside, down the driveway, to the porter potty, wait for me, then go back to sleep while trying to shake off the shivers that controlled her like the puppet master. Knowing @TIME1, she was not happy with @TIME1 situations, I'm sure nobody would be. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she would get up to take me to the restroom.  The @TIME1 came that she had to take me. We started walking down the driveway. The wind was not like other nights, ripping every which way and piercing through @CAPS2 skin. Another odd thing about @TIME1 was instead of the dull tired face @CAPS2 aunt usually would have, she was awake, more the awake, she seemed to have a slight grin on her face. Since it was pitch dark she had the flash light with her. She opened the door to let me in and shinned the light down in the cracks so I would be able to see more clearly. Once I was done, I felt the shaking of the porter potty and heard in the voice of a monster the "@CAPS1 y was coming to get me, run, run run!" @CAPS2 blood rushed all over, warmth is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door open, screaming, running for @CAPS2 "safety" is what went through @CAPS2 mind. As I realized @CAPS2 aunt wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning behind @TIME1 would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can turn it into a laughing matter instead of a dreaded time. @CAPS2 aunt making me do something she would think was funny would be a better sense for her and relieve her from whatever she thought she felt. Its a cause and effect placement. Causing me to panic effected her to be at more of an ease.

 Have you ever felt really good after you laughed a lot? Well studies have shown that after you laugh you not only feel better, but it's a great way to lose calories. One time when I felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, she to only made the day better but put more energy in it. When people don't laugh how can you have as much fun?  Studies have shown laughing does a lot for your health. It increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy. It has also shown that laughing leads to a longer life span. Also every time a person laughs it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you why not laugh a lot? Just think, if nobody laughed how would this world be? It would be dull and full of unhappy people, just like this one time when my cousin came over to see me.  One day I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to @ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was in @ORGANIZATION1 one day after school and looking at some things when she came in @ORGANIZATION1 and snuck up in back of me and scared me. We both started laughing so hard. She made a bad day turn into a fun one. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles all night. We made songs up and sang them. We had the best time of our lives. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everybody if none of us ever laughed.  If we didn't laugh then our relationship certainly wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time. If their was no laughing I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around and didn't laugh. Laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows your comfortable with the person and are having fun also. If you have ever been down and wanted to give up, you know that's not fun at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it puts in your life. So laughing must be an important part of you life or in any relationship you have.  Overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. Also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need some happiness in your life then watch a funny movie or hang out with people that make you laugh.

Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people think of laughter as a way of showing how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you @MONTH1 laugh when something is funny, but the truth is that you can control it. So @CAPS5 do people laugh? They laugh to convey a message; basically they are letting you know that what you said or did was amusing to them. Overtime, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you are sharing a common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would have never met my best friend. When I began sixth grade, I was scared. I was scared that I would lose all of my old friends and become one of those kids who sits alone in the cafeteria every day wishing that he had someone to eat his greasy pizza with. Of course I was overreacting, but the thought was always lingering in my mind all through the first few days. Soon I even began to notice that my friends were actually find new people to hang out with, and I was beginning to feel as though I was becoming that outcast I had feared to be. Then I met him. He was a skater kid with dark hair down past his eyes and white, almost pale, skin. I was with one of my few friends, @CAPS3, when I saw him riding around near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him besides the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I had ever seen. I was actually surprised when @CAPS3 walked up and started to talk to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of being any more of an outcast. As soon as we are standing in front of him, he says something like an insult that I would usually brush off as nothing, but this time for some reason made me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it, we were in verbal warfare. In the end I knew one thing: I hated that kid, and he hated me.  Towards the middle of the year, our school had a dance. It was the first dance I had ever been to and I had butterfly's in my stomach. I got a ride with one of my old friends, @DATE1. I liked @DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything like that, he was just friendly. When we were in the car driving to the middle school, he told me that he had to pick some else up, which didn't really bother me at all until we got to the house. The house wasn't very impressive it could have been a cardboard box for all I cared. When i saw the the kid's left foot step out of the house I knew exactly who's shoe it was. As he got in to the car, I pretended as if I hadn't seen him. I failed. The whole car ride was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance I walked on the right side of @DATE1 to avoid confrontation. @DATE1 scenced the tension and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a little. "@CAPS5 don't you guys just get along?" We both stood there, eyes locked, when skater kid made another one of his "nice comments". I thought it was going to be the beginning of the year all over again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time ever, we were friends. The whole night we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends.  During the rest of the year, we became better and better friends. We went over to eachother's houses and hung out at school. That was when I realized that we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade we are still best friends. It's crazy how one small giggle can escalate into that, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing is certain: laughter is important.

 Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white "@NUM1" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across "#@NUM2". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath "@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today.

 My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a tradition that we made up. Every time she comes over to my house we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with @TIME1 @CAPS4 she was spending the @TIME1 at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do it suddenly hit me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said"@CAPS1 could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, @CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been sitting right under their noses the whole time?" and to @TIME1 she says "I'm listening." @CAPS2 we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do.I said "I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find." The two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase."@CAPS3 @CAPS1 do we need all these pillows for?" @PERSON2 asked and was surprised @CAPS4 i said "for padding." @CAPS4 the pillows were set up at the foot of the stairs, I told her of my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to get started. "@CAPS5 purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME1" said @PERSON2.  I ran down the hallway to my room, snatched my sleeping bag, and sprinted back towards the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is super slick and was just the thing we needed to glide down the stairs.  @CAPS2, @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still have fun doing @TIME1. Over the @DATE1 we have improved it, making it nerve racking and loads more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. @CAPS4 we are just using the sleeping bag we don't need them, but as we have added on to that we have agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet kind of scares my mom because it's even needed. One @TIME1, while my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had been eating way too much sugar and were extremely hyper. The two of us were sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy,and wasn't as much fun as it was @CAPS4 we were about @DATE1 @DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever before! We started brainstorming. My brothers room was upstairs and we somehow wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress out onto the staircase. We both sat down on the mattress, pushed off, and went shooting down the stairs. We could barely keep a hold of the mattress. The farther we went down the staircase, the farther we slid off of the mattress. We were laughing @CAPS3 hard @CAPS4 we got to the bottom, we almost slammed into the wall! It was @CAPS3 much fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before we went crashing down the stairs, was how heavy the mattress was. It was very hard to get back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having @CAPS3 much fun.  @PERSON2 and I were getting tired @CAPS3 we decided to take a break. The two of us hauled the mattress up the stairs , it one last time before plopping down on the couch in the opposite room. Not too long ago my mom had bought an inflatable exercise bean. Shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON2 started messing around with it, and @CAPS4 she said "@CAPS6 try it?"We both rushed back to the stairs, ready to have some more of the reckless fun that we love. Our imaginations were bouncing off the walls. @TIME1 time the two of us felt it was time to mix everything together for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be. Our idea was to be sitting on the exercise bean, on top of the mattress, slide down off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying into the pillows at the bottom of the staircase. I found some duct tape @CAPS3 the @PERSON2 could tape the sleeping bag to the floor.  @PERSON2 let me go first. I was nervous because we'd never done @TIME1 before. After a minute a finally pushed off. It was a bigger drop from the mattress to the stairs than I thought it would be. @CAPS4 I landed on the sleeping bag it was like being inside of the @PERSON1 video game, and hitting the turbo boost. It was scary but @CAPS4 I got to the bottom the two of us were laughing uncontrollably. We had @CAPS3 much fun.

                                                   THE @CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          
<START>

 We were all ging out in to the woods to go ride quads and trikes, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 had quads I was the only on with the trike. We loaded the trike and quads in the back of the truck and trailer and was off to the woods. We get out their and uloaded our rides, we get all of them warmed up but the one with a clutch. the only way to get that one started is to pull it with the automatic quadWilber says to @PERSON1 that he will get it started so u pull me. I get up their and hook the rope on to aech quad @PERSON1 says hes ready,so @PERSON1 is taking off fast and some how the hook just comes off and hits him prfectly on his back he gets up and it looks like hes dancing. He lifted up his shirt and asked s if there was any mark, oh man was there the hook hit him perfectly, it looked judt like a hook wa printd on his back.             @PERSON1 starts to taer up a liitle bit while holding his back. i didnt blame him i would of to, u could hear it snap when it hit him. I look over at @PERSON1 and hes trying not to laugh, @PERSON1 looks over at @PERSON1 and gets off the quad and started to chase him. I finally got there attention and said,"we came out here to ride not to kick some ass." we finally get the bike going but @PERSON1 was to scared to pull the quad so i had to do it, as soon as we get the quad with the clutch to warm up, a cop car comes down by us then turns his lights on. We new what we were going to have to do so as soon as i see @PERSON1 take off i took off. @PERSON1 and I look back to see if @PERSON1 was behind us and no he was not.             @PERSON1 told me we should just leave him ,but i told him that would be way to mest up we come back and the cop told us he was suprized that we came back. we asked @PERSON1 what happend and he didnt know after dealing with the cops for the day, we tried to figure out what was rong with the bike and we found out some one was messing with the carbrator and they were totally off.             it sucked we dont get our licences tikll we eighteen ,but for @PERSON1 its twenty one, that really sucks for him. After that one day @PERSON1 promised that he would never go with @PERSON1 and I again.             
<START>

 My family and I went to our vacation house once in awhile to see how things were going. We would spend a couple days or a week there. It was nice, got to hang out with our neighbors, ride quads, feed the rabbits, horses and cows, put on make-up.    Sometimes my dad and i would be sitting on the porch and look at the scenery. The beautiful suset, the trees and their colors. A crowd of deer wandering around, picking on the groumd eating the scraps of food. The cows walking along the fence line waiting for dinner to go their way. While we were sitting there we would talk about random things or play jokes on eacother and just laugh and have a good time.  One evening when we were sitting on the porch my dad asked if i would like to take a walk. I said yes and so we went into the pasture, and somehow he had a camera. We walked and talked and he took pictures of everything. I wasn't looking but suddenly he was taking pictures of me. I looked at him and i saw that the camera was facing me and his finger was holding the button and wasn't letting go of it. I ran in circles and laughing so hard that i was crying and i couldn't stop. He kept going in circles, as me, still taking pictures of me and we were just laughing and laughing.

 Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter I believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of @CAPS1 stomach, and it finally bursts joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a @DATE1 day hearing the bugs hum with the warm breeze, and knowng I am able to float up into the cotton candy clouds, then not realizing I'm laughing at everything I do. Laughter flips @CAPS1 gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyone's @CAPS2. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to be around older kids, and so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with @CAPS1 old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. @CAPS1 old best friend never left @CAPS1 side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking thruogh the crammed hallways of a huge school with just air breezing by me.  School became unpleasent to go to everyday for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather social with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls), made jokes about @CAPS1 appearence or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of @CAPS1 sixth grade year and I felt alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, @CAPS1 eyes would spew gallons of salt water tears down @CAPS1 face splashing @CAPS1 pillows. @PERSON1 was @CAPS1 other best friend and never teased me or talk behind @CAPS1 back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their cartain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on @CAPS1 own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed @CAPS1 loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @CAPS1 stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody two-shoes that is so dreadfully boring. @CAPS1 smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through @CAPS1 class like a disease. @PERSON1 left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me.  The girls who talked bad about me behind @CAPS1 back were left to do whatever they desired, while @PERSON1 filled the breezy air by @CAPS1 side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in @CAPS2 I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words laughter pulled me out of @CAPS1 awful pit I hid away in and made me find @CAPS1 true friends in @CAPS2. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because I can have an enjoyable time.  
<START>

Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did.

 Laughter is an essential component to any relationship, as it can erase any previous uneasy feelings and has a tendency to bring two people together. This phenomenon stays true whether the individuals involved are in the same room, talking over the telephone, or even communicating over the internet. My best friend and I share a special bond in which laughing has played a large role in keeping us together.  Laughter can keep people together even in times of hardship. My best friend, @LOCATION1, is @CAPS1, and we have shared many laughs over the @DATE1 years we have been friends. We first met while playing an online computer game and immediately enjoyed each others comments and comical statements. We would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny. He and I shared many laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently his family had financial troubles and was not able to pay the internet and phone bills for several months. Work during this time seemed to be more of a burden than usual, as I had few people I could truly relax and have a laugh. Only the occasional laugh with my friends who live locally could cause me to forget the disappointment I had from missing one of my greatest friends. @DATE1 weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and I would be again able to communicate as before. While staying up @TIME1 one @TIME1 doing homework, I noticed that I had received a message from the long-lost @LOCATION1. I immediately chuckled inside, thinking of the good times we had shared just a month earlier. To my disappointment, the message which I received was not to tell me that he had internet at his house once again, but to thank me for the @CAPS2 gift and to tell me he was at another friends house for the @TIME1. He also mentioned that he would enjoy playing a game or two with me during this time. While this provided some comfort, it did not fully satisfy my hunger for laughter because his computer which he had taken with him was missing the drivers which allowed the use of a microphone. That afternoon, though somewhat disappointing, reminded me of the many great times we had shared together. One @DATE1 ago, my hopes were finally confirmed when @LOCATION1 messaged me to tell me that he had internet again. Though we had missed being together during the @DATE1 break, we were thrilled to once again be able to communicate. I am glad the @TIME1 he chose to get internet was a @DATE2, because we played and laughed till @TIME1. The laughter which we shared that @TIME1 washed the disappointment far from both our minds. My days are once again complete, as they are now an almost perfect balance of work and laughter. Laughter truly does bring people together, far more than I had previously realized. Though my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we talk and laugh together, it seems as though he is in the same room with me. I hope that some day soon we @MONTH1 be able to actually be in the same room, sharing laughs and enjoying life. This example is just one of the many where laughter has greatly improved the outcome of a particular situation, making the individuals involved even closer together than they had been before.

  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS1 year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do.

 Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like "I'm happy to meet you." @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love.

 Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said " i'm only going to say this once". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, "messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it"

 Laughter plays a huge part in my life, my family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4.  There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play; no one ever oficaly gave it a name so we just call it theLaughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in froung of everone else thats playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really dont play that often just @CAPS8 their'se nothing else to do. One night my two nefues and I were just siting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nefue @PERSON2 said "@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2". His older brother @PERSON1 and I didnt really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we bouth said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS4 and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about a houre or so it started to get boaring. @PERSON1 and I were strating to get board out of our minds so we were going to ouit, but my little nefue didnt want us to. @PERSON2 went up to take a turn. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS7 after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying "@CAPS6 this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box." The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. "@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar." @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the "guy" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @PERSON2 he didnt want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Weather were just hanging out and telling a couple of joaks or making up a @CAPS2 we love to laugh. Lauchter has a huge part in my life.

@CAPS1 do @CAPS2 know were my wax for my skin board is? I yelled to my @CAPS1 as i walked out of my room.I think it is on @CAPS8 book shelve but why do @CAPS2 need it?" my father replied.It's for @PERSON1's birthday present, I don't @CAPS4 any money for him and i promised him something amazing this year so i am going to take him to @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and we are going to ride are canoe down the giant sand dune.why cant @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree? my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying @CAPS8 the stupidest kid i know.@CAPS2 know i don't take handouts @CAPS1 i would @CAPS4 to work for that money and i don't @CAPS4 enough time to work for it and hangout with @PERSON1 all day, I mean it is his birthday after all and besides this is more fun I said with a mischievous grin on my face.Well alright the canoe is already hooked up to the truck, my @CAPS1 replied.That's fine with me pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back? I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS2 here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS8 taking me on today he asked? @CAPS2 will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS8 living room watching the @ORGANIZATION1 win there game when @CAPS8 done. So leaving @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 to change I waited outside @PERSON1's room. Alright, said @PERSON3 we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON1 yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS1 was still waiting. So @PERSON1 said to my @CAPS1 as he got into the back seat do @CAPS2 know what @CAPS8 son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS2 going fishing @PERSON1? @PERSON3 asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON1. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON1's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON2. Turning into @PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS1 saying I don't think @CAPS2 will want me to @CAPS4 these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank. As we reached the other bank we all jumped out and i pulled the canoe up onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand duneWe are going to push this up the dune then wax the bottom and ride down the hill in it i said smiling madly at them bothYour stupid the commented together but were down they sad starting to push the canoe up the hill. As we reached the top we flipped the canoe over and started hurriedly waxed the bottom, then pushed it to a likely spot to slide down and all jumped in we slide forward a little but stoped. Without another word me and @PERSON3 jumped out and pushed with while running then jumping in we flew on down the sand dune and hit the water with a thud snapping the canoe in two as it flipped me out to a log ten yards away as i saw @PERSON3 fly out and hit the water with a cannon ball as @PERSON1 just fell out the side into the shallows. When i emerged i heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank."@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9' "

 Have you ever been laughing at something that someone said, and then began laughing harder at, not the joke, but at a person whose laugh was almost more humorous than the joke itself? Then were you put into a good mood after the funny laughing occurred, when just before that you could have been in the world's worst mood? Laughter is the cure for almost anything from being in a bad mood to crying because you're sad. It can also help make the mood in the room brighter or simply it makes any awkward moment disappear. One bright @DATE1 day, @PERSON1 called me and asked if I wanted to long board down to @PERSON2's and get some lunch with her. Of course I wanted to because I'm always up for my typical @PERSON2's order of a chocolate malt milkshake and some croutons and ranch. I jogged to her house down the block and we long boarded down to @PERSON2's in downtown @CAPS1. On the way to @PERSON2's I shared with @PERSON1 how I had not had a good day so far and how I needed to be cheered up. She was feeling the same way. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up with each others lives and eat. When we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed to be that day as we waited for a table. After getting seated we noticed an older couple sitting in the booth behind us, some kids from our school in the booth front of us, and a man and women across the aisle. @PERSON1 ordered a strawberry milkshake and a burger with fries, and I ordered my usual. After the lady took our order and left, @PERSON1 and I started telling each other the reasons for our bad moods. She was in a bad mood because her friend @PERSON3 was not treating her right. I was in a bad mood because my friend @CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never happened.  We were both quite upset and frankly we were in no laughing mood. When all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a mixture of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. We turned around to find it was a lady's laughter. I looked at @LOCATION1 and she looked at me and we started busting up laughing. This went on for about @NUM1 minutes straight. We both could not believe a sound like that could come out of any human being's mouth and it was probably the loudest laugh I've ever heard. We also loved the fact that all of this is happening at a public place with all these people around, and the lady was just setting herself up for being made fun of. @PERSON1 and I continued to laugh at the lady for how she was laughing and it somehow started to relieve our bad moods. @PERSON1 started smiling a little more and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.   Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Regardless if the laugh is a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's great way to turn a awkward moment into a memorable moment. Someone once said, "laughter is the shortest distance between two people," and that person knew what they were talking about.

 There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood.

 What is one of the most important parts of a relationship? Laughter would be one of the most important part of a relationship in my mind. Such as my relationship with @PERSON1, and @ORGANIZATION1. We are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke. But when we are all together cheering is the funniest for example when our varsity cheer squad went to @LOCATION2. We got locked out of our bus then we got kick out of a @ORGANIZATION2. Last but not lest we had the funniest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, that night we will never be forgotten. When we first arrived at @LOCATION2 our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked it all up. One of the girls noticed when she went out to get her ipod. We all tried to think of some ways out of this. We first tried to put @PERSON1 through the window. But that unfortunately did not work so well because we could not get any of the windows open. Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys.  After the game our cheer squad went to @ORGANIZATION2. Because before the game she promised we could go to get some cookie dough if we were good and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 and I ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could. One of the people who worked at @ORGANIZATION2 said that we could not run in the building. We followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead. We got stopped again and they didn't mean do cartwheels or round offs down the halls either. as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it. Turns out that's not allowed in @ORGANIZATION2 either. We got sent back to our coach. Unfortunate for us we stumbled on to another interesting thing it was a short little dresses on a clothing rack. @PERSON1 and I put them over our cheer uniforms. As @PERSON1 was about to take a picture a girl who worked there came up behind us. @PERSON1 the good friend she is ran off with out telling us. @PERSON1 decides to take the picture instead, after the lady saw what we were doing we got kicked out.  The last crazy event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. For thous of you who don't know what that is it is simply when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone besides the driver of course gets out and runs around the bus like crazy people. We were just about to leave @LOCATION1 when the light turns red. I was standing by the door waiting for a light to turn red. i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door I ran out as fast as I could. Sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt. Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus. But the light turned green as soon as I rounded the corner. The people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either. Honestly no body cared we were having so much fun to even think about the other people. As @CAPS7 another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face. Then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again. we waited on the bus for it to turn green. @CAPS7 and I were covered in mud. Everyone one was taking the mud off of @CAPS7 and I then put it on them self's. But since everybody was rubbing the mud it just got really dry and uncomfortable.  In conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship. With out it our squad wouldn't have half the funny memories we do. That night was just one of the most funniest all of the things that happened that night were just so humorous. Including getting locked out of the bus, getting kicked out of @ORGANIZATION2, and the best of all the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That night will never be forgotten by me or any of the other people that were there.

 From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being "in on" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the "good old days" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the @PERSON3 children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my @CAPS1 nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my @CAPS1 (@PERSON4), @PERSON1, @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 @CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, "@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs."  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my @CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with @CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.

 Laughter leads to happiness. Happiness is a key to life. Laughing is a communication click with life, it brings you a warm feeling inside @CAPS1 you laugh. Think about it. For example, @CAPS1 you go on your first date with this wonderful guy that you are so excited but yet nervous because you don't know how he is going to act. You have all these thoughts going through your mind like, will he like what I'm wearing? Will he think I'm beautiful? What do i talk about? and trust me i bet you he is think the exact same things you are. You get to the restaurant and hes a gentlemen, he pulls your chair out for you and comes off sweet as can be. The first thing he dose is make you laugh. Laughing really changes things doesn't it? makes you feel you know comfortable.    Now lets take it back. You show up with guy he says, "hello" you sit down and he talks about the most boring subjects, doesn't smile talks kinda of quiet, makes you bring up all the subjects to talk about.Witch couple do you think is more likely to go forward? The first example right? laughing lights up everything smiling makes people happy and it feels comforting.   laughter and smiles i know falls under the same category i mean @CAPS1 you smile your happy. @CAPS1 you laugh you have to smile and usually @CAPS1 your laughing your happy about something or someone. i love @CAPS1 people make me laugh and smile it makes you feel like everything's going to be ok, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 it's not. people don't realize part of communication is smiling and laughter, they kinda ignore and come as kinda, well ya know boring witch makes a person no fun at all. Everyone has to have some joy in there life, and if not there are people out there that can help.  Do you notice gloomy people? People that are sad all the time kind of afraid of life? Maye been through a lot of hard times. Gosh I cant even imagine what some people are going through what some people are going through these days but anyway, smile lightens there heart. Makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling. just by passing on a face showing that you don't know them but maybe you can feel that there not doing well, or are hurting.   I work at a restaurant in my town here in @LOCATION1 as a waitress. I love my job and i enjoy making people smile and laugh, it makes them feel comfortable. This lady walked in my work and it was a late after noon. She we looking around at all the other customers, but it wasn't the people that were sitting with here sisters or brothers even kids. It was the couples she was looking at she looked very unhappy and it seemed to me that she probably was in a divorcee or break up she just looked very sad. knowing myself all i wanted to do was help her even put a smile on her face because i care. I went over to her table and sat down by here, remember i don't even know this lady. I looked at her and said " you know everything is going to be alright" and smiled at her. Within seconds her face lit up it was like the whole restaurant had lit up. She put a smile on her face. You know its the little things in life that make everything ok.

 When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend.  @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. "@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along," she whispered and then exploded," @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS6.. its the first day of many!" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON1. As I turned towards @CAPS7 destination again, a branch met @CAPS7 vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 sprang to @CAPS7 side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 made me cry; @CAPS3 was @CAPS7 appearance that had me down. People would asked for days "@CAPS4 is on your face" and "@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, "@CAPS6, how are you?"@CAPS7 face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, "@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!"@CAPS7 friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. "@CAPS10," she called out to me, " I'm @CAPS2 agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship.

 The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS2 @PERSON1 sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM1 acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM2 can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2 pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS3 walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS2 was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS2, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS2 had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS2 and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying " laughter is the best medicine" put to justice better. My @CAPS2 was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor.

 When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  "@CAPS3,"she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out.

When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to go hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1. We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION1, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON2 said "why don't I call my dad to see if he would" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON2 and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON2 that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION1. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS1 she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM1 minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON2 the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS1 I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON2, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION1 so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION1 with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat.

It was a normal sunny day in the country hill's of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shineing on the creek that me, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little brigde that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1.  Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sun filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different then normall. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm hands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was alittle mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that lead to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didnt believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of the sudden @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and i turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast i could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and i wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surround my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to deside weather we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he made it and soo did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up alittle and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought i was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and i flung over the fence and face planted it. It was super embbarrasing. My friend and brother were both laughing histarically at me. I could tell my face was beat red and i was mad that i fell. Again. Although i still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a row boat were my brother and friend was and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scareiest thing i had experianced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about eachothers faces as we where running and how funny it was that i face planted it. They made fun of the face i made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though i was embarrased that i tripped over the fence, I still found my self laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crieing. We all asked her what was soo funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to point we all cried. We all told the story the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus its a great ab work out!!!!

       Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  @CAPS1 after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at @ORGANIZATION1's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said @CAPS2 matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy.

 I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our "good byes". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto "where it counts" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your "sensitive" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter.

 Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. "A day without laughing is a waste of a day." @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, "@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does." @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. "A day without laughing is a waste of a day."

 Laughter is what connects me @PERSON1 my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relatioship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh, @PERSON1 we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me @PERSON1 two of my friends went to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2... We sort of had a hard time getting out. Me @PERSON1 my friends, @PERSON1, went to @LOCATION1 to do a cultural performance at @ORGANIZATION1. When we were done we started heading back home. @PERSON1 kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we got to @LOCATION2 so we could stop somewhere. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I suggested @ORGANIZATION2. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION2 was doint the potty dance. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting @PERSON1 was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, @PERSON1 finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed @PERSON1 a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it @PERSON1 told her it was outside behind the building. @PERSON1 took the key @PERSON1 sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. Little did @PERSON1 know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door @PERSON1 fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... Especially @PERSON1. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead she had an "accident" on the floor in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. Laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have @PERSON1 it helps build new ones also.

                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life.

                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life!

 I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!
<START>

 A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS1, in @LOCATION1. He is going off to the @CAPS2 pretty soon, so spending time together was the main goal. @CAPS1 and I have a a close bond, we talk as much as we can through the phone. This trip meant a lot to both @CAPS1 and I, we don't know how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every laughter, and smile was something that we will always remember.  My parents and I went to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1 I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember- on our @DATE1 in @LOCATION1- my cousins and I got lost in the town we stayed. Now let me say in that town there is no way someone can get lost, it's so small. So when we got lost, we found it so funny and unbelievable that we got lost. Fortunately it was during the @DATE1, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say it wasn't our fault, we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions. Because it was such a funny mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car all three of us were argued where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrasing, niether of us wanted to see that taxi driver again. @CAPS1 is older and way more taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @CAPS1 is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave. Until one night all of that was forgotten while @CAPS1 spent the @TIME1. I shared a room with my two other cousins and @CAPS1 stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME1, when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room. The next thing I hear is @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was scared also, so my cousins and I decided to let him come in. I turned on the light while @CAPS1 and my brother were coming inside the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 came in with the airbed. It was such a funny sight so we all started laughing. @CAPS1 said " I @MONTH1 be big and tall but I get scared easily", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street. I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family. While my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest. My cousins, @PERSON3 and I were in my room- like always the funny moments happened in my room- we were just bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly I was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @PERSON1 comes up with this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's face, I knew they were serious. So here I am opening a suitcase, taking everything out meanwhile @CAPS1 goes and gets his camera. The next thing I know I'm getting inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I really flexible, so when I notice that I am having no trouble getting inside the suitcase, I freak out. My brother is practically peeing his pants from laughing so hard, my cousins are just baffled at what they were witnessing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them that was to far, but they convinced me to zip up the zipper so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 my brother and my third cousin @PERSON2 all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents. I came out of the suitcase- I felt so dizzy- after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes on how tiny I am as well as how much fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then @CAPS1 calls me "@CAPS13". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him in a long time is unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like a brother. In our entire trip, neither of us could speak of him going, instead we chose to just have fun and ignore the pain. Laughing made that pain go away. It made our trip worth going.  
<START>

 My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer.

                            Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a "natural high" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... "@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!

 Laughter...What is laughter? Laughter is what makes the world go round.Its what makes friendship and relationship click.Laughter can lead to romance to marriage.without laughter,people would be sad and depressed.They would be stubbing there feet when they walk.People would be stressed out all the time.There would be a lot more wars.The world would not survive with out laughter.That is what I know about laughter.
<START>

Laughter, an important part of life, just the feeling of laughing is comforting because at that time everything is okay.Laughing brings people together and makes them laugh together, its like a way of communication. Once you laugh about something other people start laughing and it connects everybody together to be happy. Its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them.That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's a different story.I remember one day when I was home washing the dishes and everyone in my family was frustrated, even me.I hate being mad and I hate it when people get mad, so I said something, I don't remember what but then everyone started laughing,it put everyone in a good mood.I think of laughing like fire,one candle can light @NUM1 candles.When you hear people laugh, the first thing that comes to your mind is,"something must be funny".And you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too. that's very common for most people who like laughing. personally I love laughing because its a good weird feeling.

 Laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends. Laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day. It is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and I. It is why we have been friends for so long. One of my best friends is named @PERSON1 and the other is @PERSON3. I have been friends with them for @NUM1 years now. We are all very close and we do every thing together. We hang out together, we play soccer together, we live close together, and we laugh together. @PERSON1 loves to go camping with her family in the @DATE1. The past @NUM2 years she has taken @PERSON3 and I along. @CAPS2 last trip I had been texting a lot on the trip @CAPS3 i was the only one who had service at the camp site. @PERSON1's mom had yelled at me for texting so much, which had mad me kinda angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had agreed with @PERSON1's mom and yelled at me to. I yelled back @CAPS3 I didn't like how @CAPS1 were all ganging up on me. I said "I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!" @CAPS1 were both really surprised that I said that and became intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @PERSON2 who was also on the trip with us had fallen flat on his face while he was trying to do a cartwheel. @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I all tried not to laugh @CAPS3 we were mad at each other, but we couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way that a little fight like that was going to stop us from being friends. We all hugged each other and said "I'm sorry." @CAPS2 is why laughter is such a great thing, @CAPS3 there's nothing better than knowing you have friends that are there for you and can always make you laugh even when your mad at them. It can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship. In my case laughter has fixed many problems like @CAPS2 and always will.

 Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between @PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having problems with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON1 about how @PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS3 has given me. By the @DATE2, @PERSON2 calls me and tells me that @PERSON1 called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon.

 Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.

I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that "@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like "@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot

    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her "baby sister", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, "@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called "snow". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, "@PERSON1! What is this??" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, " you still have flower in your hair".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story.

 Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show "@CAPS3 the @CAPS4". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a "mullet" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite " @CAPS6" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away.

                                   Laughter. Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship. I once knew someone that had a great relationship becuse of laughter. They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you "love" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal.

 Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been "house sitting" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.

A few years ago me, my mom and my sister @PERSON1 were at a sub shop for dinner. Whal we were in line waighting for our sandwiches, @PERSON1 who was severl inches shoter than me at the time, said that she was taller than me, so I stratend up and said that I was still taller. Then she stoud up on her tip-toes (making her taller than me) and said that she was too taller than me and she stuck her toung out at me, so I stoud up on my tip-toes (makimg me taller) and stuck out my toung at her. The funny part is that there was this cute guy standing behind @LOCATION1 so it looked like I was sticking my toung out at him! He had this amused look on his face like he was looking at some cute little kid. I quickly stuck my toung back in my mouth and returned to my normal hight. I then tolled my mom that @PERSON1 were going to find a place to sit. Once we found a place to sit I toled her abought the guy standing behind her and we both laughed it was really funny and we still joke about it! : )

Laughter can create this type of bond that's hard to sever. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the same things. Its an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or seem that funny at the time but it will make anyone I think feel better no matter what the circumstance. I can tell you how I've made some fast and true friends just by laughing at the somethings. Or how laughter can fix a fight that you and a love one have had. Well here it goes, my story of a very true and very close to home story that help me open my mind and have one of the best and true friends I well ever have in my life. To tell this story i have to go back in time to when i way around nine or so. When I was a young girl my sister, @CAPS1, or as I always called her @PERSON2, and me hated each other. We never got along, maybe that's because of sharing a room with a older sister, but i can remember her never wanting to play with me or hang out with me. My oldest sister @PERSON1 had just gone to collage so my sister @PERSON2 and me got the chance to get to know each other a whole lot more. Sure we still had fights and still didn't get along with each other very well, but we were well on are way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day when my parents went out shopping me and my sister @PERSON2 stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning music is blasting no matter what kind it is. As always my big sister had to "order" me around, or at least that's what it felt like then, and like always i was a stubborn little sister who never liked taking orders from the big sister. Well @PERSON2 told me i had to clean the bathrooms, and I hate to clean bathrooms, I mean who does right? So I tell her that wouldn't do clean them...well that doesn't go over so well with the big sister who is charge while mom and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight that was. I mean loud as loud can be. The music couldn't even be heard over the yelling and screaming. Like most fighting in my house goes, my sister and I go so feed up with each other that we stormed out of that room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still blasting and even could be heard from all the way upstairs. So as I ,and I can only guess my sister was doing the same, was plotting my revenge on my oh so "wise" sister then music changed to a upbeat classic song that is one of the most popular songs in my house hold. This song was "@CAPS2 @CAPS3", because I loved this song so much I opened my door to my bedroom. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and guess my sister had heard me because she had come out of her room and into mine. I of course didn't notice her so I had keep doing my singing and dancing. Well as soon as she started to laugh at me I stop and glared at her. @CAPS1 just stands there laughing, I had said something on the lines as well you couldn't do better then that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up making fun of each others dances and laughed all the way down stairs were we hug and said how sorry and stupid we where for fighting. Then after all that had just happened we look around us at the work to still be done. We then looked at each other and laughed and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time to, as soon as my mom and dad came home we where just doing the last bit of cleaning. @TIME1 after my mom and my dad had gone to bed my sister and I had a @TIME1 of watching movies and laughing our heads off.  That's it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends can fix and start anything with just laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives in @LOCATION1 so i don't see her a lot, but when ever i can i web chat her or call her. We spend hours laughing, it doesn't even matter what we are laughing about. That's what laughter does, it creates this bond, a deep connection. My sister and I @MONTH1 have had our fights in the past...and the future but we have laughter that always helps us stay together no matter what happens in life.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I think that laughter is really important in any part, in any kind of relationship. When people laugh, @CAPS2 get to understand each other better, @CAPS6 usually people think that you are a cool person when you say something funny, @CAPS6 laugh with them when @CAPS2 say funny stuff. It's funner with people who are laughing with you or make you laugh. There were many times throughout my life when many problems were solved by just telling a joke, saying something funny or even remembering fun memories from the past. I have many @CAPS4 that I love, but of course like in any other friendship, we've had little fights between us.  I remember one time when my @CAPS4 @CAPS6 I went to hang out at the mall. Two of my @CAPS4 came into a huge conflict because of something really weird, which later became an argument. Of course we always had little conflicts, but @CAPS7 time I guess the two girls were serious @CAPS6 mad at each other! My other friend @PERSON1 @CAPS6 I were looking at them @CAPS6 didn't know what to do. @CAPS6 my friend @PERSON1 was kind of scared that @CAPS2 might hurt each other. I told them," @CAPS1 you guys! Don't be like that!" @CAPS2 looked at me @CAPS6 stopped. So we started to walk. @CAPS6 I remembered something funny @CAPS6 crazy that those two girls @CAPS6 us did, at a camp the week before @CAPS7 happened, @CAPS6 after that camp I remember how @CAPS2 were saying how we are going to be "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 For @CAPS5" for our whole life's @CAPS6 that @CAPS2 wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started to laugh remembering what we did that camp, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at me like I'm weird or something. So I reminded them about all that fun stuff we did, @CAPS6 @CAPS2 looked at each other @CAPS6 started to laugh really hard! Because their conflict had something little to do with that camp, what @CAPS2've had forgotten!  After that @CAPS2 started to talk to each other @CAPS6 forgot about that conflict that @CAPS2 had. Sometimes I remind them about the conflict, but @CAPS2 just laugh @CAPS6 say "We were so dumb, to make that conflict!" @CAPS6 we all laugh at them."Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS7 is why I think that laughter is really imported in any friendship. @CAPS6 I think that @CAPS7 problem was solved by just saying some funny memories so @CAPS2 can laugh! @CAPS6 reminding someone a thing that @CAPS2 had forgotten.

Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying "@CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me." @CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated "well this is just awkward." The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.

                                              The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun, pools to cool down children, parents joining with friends and family to have picnics and potlucks, and late night slumber parties. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1.The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2 but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION2's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON2 would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION2 while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION2 gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON2 that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON2 and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION1 called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION2. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION1's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS3 movie!  We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORGANIZATION2. We said our thank you's and headed back to my house to eat dinner and get @ORGANIZATION2 ready to leave. The most enjoyable moments are with the people you love, they can make you laugh and cry. : @CAPS4.

 It was a cloudy @DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, "@CAPS1". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, "@CAPS2 @CAPS3". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, "@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4". Whenever we had one that said, "@CAPS9", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, "I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there", but numerous people thought she said, "I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there." @CAPS11, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him "@CAPS9" candy hearts.  We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter.

                               Sound @CAPS1  @CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. @CAPS2 the funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, "@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  "That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, "@CAPS6 the heck was that?"  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3's expression of, "@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?" That's @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song "@CAPS11" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, "I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..." we all said, "I throw my banana in the air sometimes..."  "@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own." @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, "@CAPS14 @CAPS15" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1.

                                  How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,"go get her." One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said,"I have a class with her."  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said,"actually I think you guys would be perfect together." @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, "sweet." I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, "what a great friend." @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS3 was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS3. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS3 was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS3.  I thank @CAPS4 that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS3's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS1 is. Laughing at @CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @CAPS1 around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day.

 My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON1 this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON2 this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE2 evening was the day he would ask @PERSON1 to be his wife! @PERSON2 pulled up to @PERSON1's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS1 number one. @PERSON2 couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE1 @TIME1 seemed to be full so @PERSON1 decided on @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON1 cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON2 began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2! he thought. @PERSON1 was ready to go home but @PERSON2 was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS6 step, @PERSON2's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON1 was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON2 calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME1 of his life. @PERSON1 just laughed which made @PERSON2 think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. "@PERSON1, will you be my wife?" @CAPS4 tears of joy she said, "@CAPS5! As long as @CAPS6 day can be an adventure like tonight." @CAPS6 time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now.

It was another warm muggy @DATE1 @TIME1, when @LOCATION1 my best friend and i decided to go to our friend @PERSON1's house. As soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @PERSON1's house @LOCATION1 realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @PERSON1's parents aren't home. So @PERSON1 and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @LOCATION1's cell phone charger, when suddenly...We heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @LOCATION1 and I go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @PERSON1's dirt bikes had fallen over. @PERSON1 and I pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @PERSON1 and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @LOCATION1 can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @PERSON1 tells @PERSON1 about are idea and @PERSON1 says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @PERSON1 repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @LOCATION1 has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. I tell @LOCATION1 "since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @CAPS1 bike!" next thing you know me and @PERSON1 are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @CAPS1 bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside. "@PERSON1 you go and ill meet you there!" i yell. @PERSON1 takes off down the road at about @NUM1 mph and im about @NUM1 yards behind him. suddenly I see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... When suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @LOCATION1 and shout "@PERSON1 @NUM3!!!" yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @LOCATION1 tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. It's out of my hands now so I bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @PERSON1 in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @PERSON1 a ticket and I see @LOCATION1 shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. Since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @LOCATION1 a ride home with @MONEY1 in tickets.. As soon as they leave the scene I go check to see what @LOCATION1 threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @LOCATION1 is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and I run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town...

 It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, "@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose." @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. "@CAPS1," @CAPS2 scoffed, "your the kid they think can beat me." "I guess. I never really thought about it." I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. "@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!" the coach called out, "@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking." "@CAPS1." I said, "your name is what." "@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8." I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said "@CAPS9 @CAPS10." in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,"I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening."@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, "@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two." That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, "@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me." @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Many people say that laughter is the key to life. If you can't laugh, then you are not a fun person to be around. Many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of relationships that they are having. In my opinion, I think that laughter is very important also. It lightens the mood in awkward situations, and laughter also just makes you and other people happy. And I personally, would rather be around a happy person, than one that isn't. A few days ago, my mom, sister and I decided to go to the bowling alley in @LOCATION1. We were all three invited to go, along with about @NUM1 other women from the @ORGANIZATION1 we attend. We attend the @ORGANIZATION1. We had all made reservations at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 at @NUM2 @CAPS3.  We arrived first and sat there and waited for about @NUM3 minutes. Then finally we seen some of our friends walking in. We ran over there to greet them and to show them where we were sitting. Our friends started getting their bowling shoes from the counter and then they ventured over towards us. Once all our friends got there, we began to bowl. We had a total of three @CAPS2 for everyone. My mom, sister and I were all three at one lane, and with us was two other friends. The first game we bowled a normal game. As usual, everyone was getting strikes except for me. I was getting pretty discouraged. So our second game around and we all decided to change the rules up a little bit. This round we could not bowl like we normally do. Each time it is our turn we have come up with a new way and new position of sending the ball down the lane. After awhile everyone was running out of things to try so people started laying and sitting on bowling balls and then sending a different ball down the lane. That was really hard.  Towards the end of the second game, everyone was tired. Their arms hurt and so did their fingers. My last frame I got up and picked the ball I wanted to use. I waited for the people in the @CAPS2 next to me to get done with their turn and then I went up to bowl. I got ready, and brought my arm back before I flung the ball down the lane. Just as I did that, my fingers let go of the ball and I dropped it. The whole side of the bowling alley I was on just busted up laughing. I was so embarrassed. My face was beet red. It was horrible. Then on my next turn I brought ball back, and then brought it forward and I literally threw it into the other lane. I fell to the floor laughing my head off. It was so funny. That night by far, was the best night I have had in quite a long while.

The @CAPS1 We @CAPS2 in @CAPS3  Laughter is a usual @CAPS1 used in many different ways, to release tension, to appreciate a funny joke, or maybe just to express a giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people. It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems, or difficulties with one another, away. Although I @CAPS2 a good relationship with my @CAPS4 the relationship with my @CAPS7 has always been a silent and guarded one because we @CAPS2 been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people.  Ever since I was a young girl my father and I @CAPS2 always been very close and I @CAPS2 begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS4. It might be because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, either way he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS4 he has never been much of a serious type of guy, he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones, my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS7 and I, however, has always been a rocky one, for several reasons I'm sure but one of them I believe is we were never capable of laughing together, or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and in @LOCATION3 things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature, everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor I felt guarded around her. I @CAPS2 never been able to feel like I can express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter.  A human beings laughter is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way, and not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS9 daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh.  Someone once said that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS1 everyone enjoys doing, it can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS1 we will always @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. So c'mon guys laugh a little.

   The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. " I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. " that's when we all started laughing. how could he be laughing at his own laugh. we soon realized how hard it was to stop. it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened. Now, when ever we are having a bad day. we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets. And the day is all better.

 Recently over the @DATE2 of @DATE1 I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met. This to me was a major part of learning about my family because I met up with not only my uncle , but my legitimate comedian aunt who I have known since I could remember ,and my father at a local @CAPS1 restaurant called @ORGANIZATION2. These three were all siblings, and this allowed me to peer into what siblings will joke about , talk about , and bring forth a feeling of nostalgia for each other. I myself have a stepsister, but the degree of nonsense being presented before me was of a much greater magnitude than I could ever fathom. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and @CAPS2 managed to get into. At one point I started having a very hard time breathing.The stories and all-together bad jokes being distributed made me understand that in my family there have been a long line of relatives who inherited some gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate but plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will be telling bad jokes. We dined there for a couple of hours before my dad had to leave for his home up in @LOCATION3, and I needed to be taken home to my family here in @LOCATION4. But tomorrow was planned for a day of exploration of @ORGANIZATION3 and plenty of stupid jokes to be exchanged. I woke up the next day got dressed and prepared myself for laughter I was aware I would be keeling over because of. When I met with uncle and my aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend we set off towards the fish hatchery on what I believe was the @LOCATION1. All the jokes started slow because everyone was tired and still waking for the rest of the day's trip. We arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond.We watched the fish as they swam around in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to @ORGANIZATION1. Once we had parked outside the @ORGANIZATION1 we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and eventually climbed up a an outlined path to get a get closer view of the @ORGANIZATION1 and we were enthralled. I was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom. I was able to hold it, but it shortened our visit to the @ORGANIZATION1 which was an inconvenience to everyone else but they obliged. I will remember the @ORGANIZATION1 for it's pure natural beauty. After visiting the @ORGANIZATION1 we were going to the very tourist friendly town of @CAPS2's @ORGANIZATION3. We drove by and I nearly lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before we did anything at @CAPS2's I first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat. A @CAPS4 themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment. They seated us and our host was a very nice young woman. we scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing. I had found this restaurant was a winner of tastiest burger awards. Falling into temptation I had to order one of these burgers. I do not regret doing this because it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the delight of eating. After satisfying the hunger plaguing us , our group began to browse the gift-shops and the silly novelties that they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came upon an @CAPS5-cream shop. After walking around for the day, @CAPS5-cream was the best thing in our mind to have at the time. I had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it. But I've yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our @CAPS5-cream my uncle began to share stories of @LOCATION5 which is where he was visiting from. Quite honestly I wish I could have gone back with him to @LOCATION5, it sounded like a grand city with plenty of places to explore. Sadly I could not, but it is now my goal to eventually visit him where he is living in @LOCATION5. We finished our @CAPS5-cream and then made our way toward the car and drove to @PERSON1 to eat at a very good @CAPS9 restaurant @NUM1o @CAPS10's. We dined there and our stomach was full of exquisite food, almost an entire day of very tasty and savory delights. That was my uncle's @DATE1 day in @LOCATION2. I now wish he would visit more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition across @LOCATION2 with the plethora of bad jokes and stories along with it.

   I was late like usual for the bus; barley having any time to sit before it moved. I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one in other @CAPS2 I stopped and said to them,      "@CAPS1 guys make it @CAPS2 hard to choose." I smiled sarcastically.   @PERSON1 who was sitting behind @CAPS3 motioned for me to sit with her. I gave @PERSON1 a quick smile and told her that @CAPS3 and I would turn around and talk with her. @PERSON1 smiled as @CAPS21 leaned her head against my seat. @CAPS3 and I gave @PERSON1 about five minutes of quiet, then we started talking with her. About the time we arrived at the middle school, we all were having a swell time. Until then @CAPS3 and I were fine! But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything @CAPS21 said made me laugh and everything I said made her laugh too! After we left the middle school though, this little sixth grader came to sit in front of us and boy was he annoying! He kept turning around, giving @CAPS3 and I weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course that made @CAPS3 and I crack up even more! I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well for one, I will not smoke, try it, or let it ever come near me. @CAPS2 I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought I meant joints. @CAPS3 who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat crying because @CAPS21 was laughing @CAPS2 hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder @CAPS2 that the sounds coming out of both of us, were the silent and deadly laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started taking in @CAPS8 to us. Now I'm trying to learn @CAPS8, @CAPS2 I didn't have the faintest idea of what he was saying to us. Neither did @CAPS3. Of course he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the isle to talk to these native @CAPS8 speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could know more @CAPS8, then me when he was only in sixth grade!He of course quieted right down, but the @CAPS8 speakers were howling with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears the time @CAPS3 got off the bus. After @CAPS21 got off, I decided to check in on ol' @PERSON1. @CAPS21 looked like @CAPS21 was trying to sleep, @CAPS2 I gently nudged her and @CAPS21 looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about @PERSON1 in the back until @CAPS3 got off at her stop.      "@CAPS16 @CAPS1 @CAPS17.k? Do @CAPS1 need a doctor?" @PERSON1 asked with a confused grin on her face.I tried to talk, but was laughing in between all of my words,@CAPS2 it came out as pea soup!  "@CAPS17.k, now @CAPS1 really scare me!" @PERSON1 retorted with a serious face. "@CAPS18 come on @PERSON1! I'm suppose to scare @CAPS1! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores - juniors,and juniors scare the seniors?" I explained, laughing in between it all. Still my @CAPS19 sounded like pea soup.  "@CAPS20, but @CAPS1 still scare my personally. Don't do that!" @CAPS21 belted out laughing. I had put my face over the seat, then lowered my head @CAPS2 that all @CAPS21 could see were my eyes. I then did my @CAPS22 @CAPS23 eyebrow thing in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. I thought that I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. I mean the attention was fine. But the boy still would interrupt @PERSON1 and I. He was just blurt out," @CAPS24 bueno? @CAPS24 bueno?"  @PERSON1 and I again would just look at him. He of course was soaking all the attention in. He then I think, insulted my mother, which @PERSON1 pointed out.But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood, that I wasn't going to let someone who I didn't even know, ruin it. Both @PERSON1 and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day and @CAPS2 was the proof reading my @CAPS19 paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as @CAPS21 was getting off the bus. @CAPS21 laughed and @CAPS2 did I.     Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed over the road and headed home. For fun I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy starring at me. I lost it then.

 I met my best friend @PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE2, so while they were home in @LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to @LOCATION3 together. @PERSON2 and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION1 (@LOCATION1 @PERSON1). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION1 that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON2 and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why.  Finally, a good @NUM1 hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing @PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made @PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. @CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation @PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces.@CAPS1 said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, @PERSON2 and I still do this on occasion.  The next day, I took @PERSON2 downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor @PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS3 soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE1 @PERSON2 and I will be returning to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.   
<START>

 In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.

                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do.
<START>

 Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself " @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing." @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said " hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?" and @CAPS6 laughed. " @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?" I replied.  " @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair." @CAPS6 said. " I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass." I replied. " @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go." @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. " @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?" I said " @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?" @CAPS6 replied " The bottle." I said " @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit." @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says "@CAPS16". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, " that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me " @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke." " I had nothing to say" I replied." @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl". @CAPS6 said." I know, but i cant help it". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked." @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me.

 Laughter is how me and my friends connect most of the time, and that's how i became friends with a lot of them. You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn't want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart.

The mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time i was only about @NUM1 or @NUM2? Hell i can't really remember so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever getting back to the story, so I'm looking all around our @NUM1 story house trying to find my brother but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the back ground is my family laughing as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old is running full speed up and down hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that hes never been in be for. And also shouting at the top of his lungs "@CAPS1 where you be at i can't finded you". And with one more door to open that's at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who can't find his brother. And opens up the door and out pops @PERSON1 his brother who is wearing the scary monster mask and says "I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner". So know what I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because a was so scared that he was going to come after me that night! And the funny thing is that this happened for the @DATE1 of my life so that the funny thing.

 @CAPS1 is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someones life? If there was any, or not? Also, @CAPS1 is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't "laughter" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, "it takes more muscles to frown then smile," that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. @CAPS1 would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who @CAPS2't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't no laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person your with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very "humorous" and @CAPS2't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, " @CAPS2't it ever get old being happy all the time?" "Of course not!" I would say in defense. @CAPS1 would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and @CAPS1 it's important, there are titled to their opinion. I know a few people, that don't like to be in a very cheery mood, that would prefer to be sad all the time and not care. Laughter could raise you up from that!

 When i think of a day where laughter was the element, i think of @DATE1. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend.  That morning, my decision was final, and i was going to do it. For some reason when i woke up, i felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, i went to my girlfriends house, and broke up with her. The next day, i couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day my friends were making me smile, and showing me they cared. The next day i felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day my friends were telling me jokes, and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much.  Throughout those upcoming weeks, i met another girl. I couldn't be anymore positive about my life. All i do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All i can do is just be positive, and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just lets just lives our lives to the fullest, and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side, and smile.

 My high school @CAPS1 basketball team isn't the best team, but the one thing that we do have, is the ability to make each other laugh. At the start of @DATE1 the school held try outs and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players not coming out, or team was brand new. Full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @CAPS1 team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @CAPS2 for a weekend.  When we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. We arrived at the house @TIME1. As we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @TIME1 or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories it had reached @TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  As we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. In her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @CAPS2, but @CAPS2 was no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally she reached her point. "@CAPS2's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets." @PERSON1 proclaimed. At that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @PERSON1 didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. The outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  When we finally started to calm down @PERSON2 came down stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @LOCATION1 stopped us. "@PERSON2 @CAPS4 up on the counter and look in the cabinet," @PERSON1 said. @PERSON2 hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. When she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned around and looked at @LOCATION1. "@CAPS3?" asked @PERSON2. As she turned to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 just sat @CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. "@CAPS4 me some of those chips right @CAPS2!" @PERSON1 said.  Everyone in the room started laughing as @PERSON2 was so confused to why she was asked to @CAPS4 on a counter just so she could @CAPS4 @PERSON1 chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @TIME1. The whole basketball team started laughing again. @PERSON2 got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. We all continued laughing and kept talking about @CAPS3 had just happened for the next @NUM1 minutes.  As everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @TIME1 @CAPS2 were still those moments of "@CAPS5 when this was said", and "@CAPS5 when she did this". That first @TIME1 that we spent at the beach did more for us then we realized. By going to the beach and making memories together we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @TIME1 in the kitchen. Today we still @CAPS4 on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @CAPS3 happened that @TIME1 in the kitchen.   
<START>

 It was a regular day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. @CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for @PERSON1. But I didn't know @CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). @CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. @CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 started cracking jokes about @PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, @CAPS22 we just add to the effect. @CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @CAPS22 while we waited for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 made a few more jokes about @PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When @PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. @PERSON4 followed next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push @CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, @CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. @CAPS22 about @NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at @CAPS4. @CAPS22 I pushed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7. @CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @CAPS8. My plan had worked. @CAPS19 @PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny @CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for @CAPS18 was about to happen. After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, "@CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me." @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and @CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, "@CAPS18 up kid?" @CAPS19 @CAPS4 said, "@CAPS21 this." @CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @CAPS19 he asked @PERSON4, "@CAPS18 did @PERSON1 do to your computer? This?" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of @PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was @CAPS22 funny me and @CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. @PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. @CAPS22 she told me and @CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was.  @CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass.
<START>

 Have @CAPS3 ever been in that mood were @CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, @CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said "@PERSON1, @CAPS3 can sit next to me!". @PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said "@CAPS3 saved my life.". For some reason @PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that.

 Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again.

It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of "The @CAPS1 @CAPS2" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. "@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. "We need a ladies costume @CAPS4."I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. "@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..." I said a little confused."@CAPS6?" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused."@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job."@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage." @CAPS7 said quickly."@CAPS11 okay, I can do that." I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. "@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...."I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. "I'm helping out with the costuming!" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day."I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on." @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper"@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing." @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice..."@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS1 shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine.

 In life @CAPS13 share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet and gentle sound of the chorus that @CAPS13 and the people in your life share. Laughter can bring @CAPS13 instantly to enjoyment no matter how unbearable the struggles in your life @MONTH1 be.  I've had many moments in my life that became enjoyable because of laughing and smiling. But one moment sticks out above the others. This moment is the @CAPS1 before my grandpa passed away. This @CAPS1 was the best of all. It was a white @CAPS1, and for once the snow wasn't the only thing that was gleaming. On this day, everyone in my family was smiling, we were all thankful that my grandpa survived his sudden heart-attack that happened the week before and we all knew that his time was near. We had to make his last @CAPS1 a great one to end on.  My grandpa was the sweetest old man, he could always make @CAPS13 smile no matter how sad @CAPS13 were. He was a man, who enjoyed the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure that he made an impact in our lives. This @CAPS1 though was one where our laughter made the largest impact.  On @DATE1, everyone on my dad's side of the family drove over the hills to their destination; my house. The house was covered in @CAPS1 decor and was gleaming with the happiness that each one of us held inside of us. My grandpa was the first to walk in. I leaped into his arms and said "I love @CAPS13 grandpa with all my heart! Merry @CAPS1!" @CAPS8 this he smiled and began to tickle me like he always did ever since I was little. He grabbed my hands and began twirling me around, humming his favorite song. As we were twirling to the tune of his favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandpa's eyes and saw the love that he had. He always said that "The laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the cruelest of people." @CAPS9 we were still twirling, all my other family members walked into the house. They smiled and laughed at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @CAPS1, nothing could ruin it for us. When everyone got into the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories of all the old and good times that we shared. We all knew that this was what my grandpa needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy that he had a family, that could put away all of the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what is was. My aunt @PERSON2 was the one that knew all of them by heart, she could even act them out. My grandpa sat there and laughed. He was filled with enjoyment as he watched his only daughter do what she did best.  When dinner was almost ready, my grandpa and I sat down at the dinner table all by ourselves. We began playing the game that we always played. I got underneath the table and hopped up in random seats acting like a cat. My grandpa would always say " @CAPS11 down @PERSON1, that food isn't for @CAPS13." then I would go and sit next to him and meow at his side, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandpa and I had. But that didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones that were always laughing; we enjoyed life and we never let anything @CAPS11 to us. He was the only one in my family that understood enjoyment and he helped me live my life that way.  Dinner was served and we all took our normal seats. My mother's food looked amazing like usual. My grandpa and I sat right across from each other like we always would and made the most unusual faces at each other. Our laughter filled the room and made that @CAPS1 even better. As we were all finishing our dinner, my grandpa got up and walked to the door looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered in a white blanket. I walked to his side and looked up at him. He smiled down at me and said "@CAPS13 never realize the beautiful things in life, until your life is fading. The most beautiful thing to me is your laugh. It always brings joy to my heart. If I could only hear one more sound, it would be your laugh @PERSON1, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I'm happy to be your grandpa and I'm glad that I got to live and see @CAPS13 grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy ever moment. Especially the moments with the ones that @CAPS13 love."

 Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had. There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE3, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE1 and we it came to be @DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself "what is wrong with her?" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life. That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh.

 Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter @CAPS2 a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION1 my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS2 one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our "uncle-nephew" relationship into a friend relationship. My life is full of laughter and will be full of laughter for my life because of one person.

 When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the " big kid" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked "how many?". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said "row eight". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled " blast off" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since.
<START>

It was @DATE2 around @NUM1 degrees in west @LOCATION1 me and a couple of friend was really bored and hot all we really had to do was stay home and play video game. So I ended up coming up with the idea of going out side and maybe riding our bikes to the store, an grabbing some ice cream and water then ride up hamburger hill and possibly sit under the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan so all my friends left we all took showers at our homes and met me up at the corner and then rode our bikes off to the store got all the items and as we were making our way to the hill a couple of the big kids who were in middle school came and jumped us all and stole all our of food supplies. Now these guys have always been picking on us for some reason and till this day @CAPS1 still never understood why maybe it was because we didn't like what they did or maybe they hate us cause my friend @PERSON3 stole one of the kids girlfriends but that's a different story. So after they got done pounding our faces into the dirt they got on their bikes and rode off into the sunset like if they were proud of themselves for beating on @NUM2 yr old, our day was ruined i had a black eye,@PERSON3 threw up, @PERSON2 was walking with a limp and poor little @PERSON1 had a little scratch on his tiny little head. After the brutal beating the next day I called a group meeting in our tree house to be for real i was tired of them constantly beating on us stealing our food and giving us ultra wedgies we needed to make a stand against our oppressors cause for too long this has been going on so i devised a plan a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again and the plan went like this, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 would talk to all of the kids that have been abused by them and get them to join our revolt,then we would get all of the water balloons eggs and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew that they always left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM3 pm so at @NUM4 at night me and @PERSON3 would flatten a couple of their tires, each thing that came into my tiny little mind was just genius so after day's of planning and hard labor and complaining to our parents for money the plan was finally set, and so we waited and just like the kid said they all came out at @NUM3 once they noticed their tires had been slashed a couple of the kids jumped out of the bushes and started hurling food at them then me and a couple of the kids was riding past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them they all split up the ones who's bikes weren't slashed they chased after us they were going pretty fast and nearly caught up with us when i gave the signal @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 pulled the rope and the big kids flew off their bikes and face planted like in the movies and it really seemed like the plan was going pretty well and it seemed like we were winning the war but as usual some thing are to good to be true it seems that we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood and when they saw this all hell broke loose soon after their reinforcements came in they over powered us like a lion on a gazelle beating each and everyone of us like we stole something but good thing i was being smart and told my parents and my friends parents on the kids and sooner our parents came yelled and screamed at them and told their parents what's been going on and as a godd ending they were grounded for the rest of them @DATE1 and finally we all played in peace without no fears.

      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.

 For a year and two months I'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS1. We started off as friends in @CAPS2 grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION1 grade. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm.    It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseperable from the get go, we literally did everything together. I was @PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @CAPS1. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everythign was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.   At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldnt keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS1, and we talked till @NUM2. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.     The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decidded to take his dog, @CAPS3, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS1.  I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devistated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered everytime I saw @CAPS1, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.   Almost everytime I thought about @CAPS1 I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS1, and thinking about @CAPS1 all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there in alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1, he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again.

 The word (laughter) @MONTH1 mean a smile or something nice that has happened to someone or even a thank you, but for many people it means the action or sound of laughing. For many people the felling they get inside when they laugh is the felling of happiness. The sense of felling good inside is the meaning that ones in while you have to be happy in life; have a balance in your life. For me the word (laughter) means being happy and the felling of doing something good in life. For instance when a couple get married they need a sense of laughter in there life's so they can enjoy their companies. It was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2 early in the morning I was extremely exited to leave because that was the day I was going to go visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle, and cousins that I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt a sense of happiness and sadness at the same time.I was about to leave for two months in a half I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time I felt happy and exited to go. That morning we arrived at the air port; I was about to ride on my very first airplane. As I tried to find my seat through the big line of people that were finding their seats as well; I sat down and buckled my self into the seat and looked out the window and all over the place. My stomach was turning in circles round and round and I had the felling of a roller coaster about to take off really fast. The next thing I knew the plane was moving I got kinda of scared, but at the same time I was excited.  During the flight I felt a sense of laughter in my soul; the memories of a childhood in @LOCATION2 were turning my emotions into laughter and tears that made me fell good I had never felt. The idea of seeing all my family and friend was captivate to my hear and emotions. As we arrived at the @LOCATION1 airport; my emotions were turning in circles back and forth. We only had two more flights left to get to our destinations. I was getting tired and sleepy, my legs and arm's hurt so bad, they felt like if you were caring two big bags of potatoes on each side of my leg and arms . We decided go eat some place as we walked around to see what we could find to eat we found pizza huts. The next thing I knew was that we had only one hour our to the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. As we arrived to the gate people were already going in through the hallway to get into the plane so we hurried. Three hours past buy and we had landed in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 that was our destination. I felt a sense of laughter inside of me as we waited for our ride home; the feeling I got was as if someone had token something from me and gave it back. I started to cry at that moment, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived that late afternoon to my grandparents house, as I looked at them I felt a happy inside, they were happy as well. we decided to spend the @TIME1 over at my grandparents house, that @TIME1 nobody had gone to sleep every one was to busy talking with each other and catching up. The next day every one was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside.  We had spent a mouth in a half with family members that I had not seen in a while we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an incredible time catching up with family and friend. We did not get to do all the things we wanted to, but the best part was the time I has with my family and friends. The word laughter to me mean the best thing that has happens to you and makes you fell good inside, or even the memories you think about when you are alone and sad, those are the memories that will make you laugh and fell good about yourself. Other people @MONTH1 say that laughter is the felling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best felling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life laughter was an important element of my whole life and it still is a great part in my life. Over many generations people have used the benefits of laughter in their life's for instance many famous and non- famous people, important people or non- important. Many people say that when you are not happy you are going to die not knowing what happy is. People really enjoy those moments that they spend with a special someone.
<START>

 There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, "@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us."That's my dog." @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far.

  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said "I love you @CAPS1". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said " @CAPS1 my head hurts". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1

 Laughter, what is the meaning; to show mirth, joy, or scorn with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in there life go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, "the light being happiness." The days @MONTH1 turn into to months or even years, life seems to be at a standstill.  When you feel there is no happiness you begin to have doubts on your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life seem to all be wrong. This is what my life felt like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend just flipped her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I didn't know so many things could rush through your head in that given moment. I instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital. All I could do once I got home was lay in my bed and think; what could I have done so she would not have been in that car-- all i felt was guilt! That night was wretched my mind just kept wrapping around all the times my best friend and I spent together, the laughter we shared between each other, stupid fights, and all the dumb pranks. What was eating at me most though was we had gotten in a fight not to long before she wrecked; the worst part was it was over the stupidest thing. I had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend. Now that I look back at it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she would not have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. That next morning her mother called me and said "she is asking for you, you @MONTH1 come to the hospital and see her if you please." I was ecstatic, I got ready faster than I ever have before; within a few minutes I was ready and in my pick-up driving myself to the @LOCATION1 hospital. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you around forty -five. I instantly jumped out of my truck, rushed into the hospital and went to the check-in desk to see what room she would be in. They told me she was in room @NUM1 right down the hall on the left. I got to room @NUM1, there was a crack in the door so I peeked in before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally got the confidence to open the door and go talk to her. She instantly had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat right next to her. We talked for about an hour just about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken rips and a minor concussion, so she should be able to be out by that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people right at that moment. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like laughter of relief. It did not take long before both of us started laughing, most of it was out of excitement and having nothing else to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter coming out of our mouths. I have to say it felt good just to be by my friends side again being able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of Laughter to me; shall you ask? It is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possible do. Laughter is to show signs of happiness, a giggle or an outburst; sharing unforgettable moments with a loved one.Without laughter your life can not be complete, make jokes, just laugh make life have meaning again. Do not go through life being @PERSON2, instead be @PERSON1. Go ahead test it out and see what laughter can do for you in your life!

 @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, "We just moved in. You have to come see our new place." @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. "@CAPS2 isn't funny!" I cried. His expression became serious, "@CAPS3, I... what happened?" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, "@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: "jerk!" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. "@CAPS7," glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, "@CAPS6 was really cute," I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. "and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together.

Warm @CAPS1 Laughter @MONTH1 be the best medicine, but it @MONTH1 also be the best glue. When one laughs, especially with another, it brings a sense of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is a release of amusement, and that literally means "not thinking". In this moment, people open themselves up and it brings a warm feeling of the heart that is shared between each other. Without this connection or ability to jest, people begin to think too much and become overly critical about relationships. To flirt is to make fun or light of a situation, the point of this is to put people at ease so they @MONTH1 open up. Flirting can consist of many things, such as joking, impressing, or complementing; usually this leads to laughing or excessive giggling. When this warming connection begins, so does the bond between the people, such as it was with my own girlfriend. I just came off the back end of a hurtful experience with another girl, so I had become tough at heart. I was a bit of a nervous kid, so when she started to be pleasant and kind to me, I started to grow out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see some silly yo-yo man who had come to their church. It was a great way to start off what we have been building now for two years, as well as comfortable setting to meet the parents.   Sometimes the key to opening up, or bonding, is to make a fool of oneself. It's hard to laugh with someone who is being prideful or too analytical; laughter is a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being a dork @MONTH1 just be the best way to be in a healthy relationship. My relationship is very well balanced between supporting each other, being critical, and being idiots. I take sacrifices to make her laugh, and she does the same for me, but mostly this results in both of us being profusely happy and laughing together. Being a man is not the same as being stubborn or powerful, I feel it's more about being open and compassionate. To be open enough to have someone to laugh with, one has to be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is an @CAPS2, a socially transforming device, and it spreads rapidly.  The same goes for a simple social gathering. Does anyone become the "life of the party" without laughing at themselves? They are typically the ones going out of their way to be ridiculous for everyone else to see, because once it starts, it spreads exponentially. Being comfortable is the foundation of having a good time, otherwise people are acting paranoid, refuse to participate, and downright seem cold. Laughter's bright tone is a good way to get people comfortable and relaxed. Think of people as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is difficult to pour and spread around when it's cold, it's thick and condensed. You can't do much with cold @CAPS1, so you have to warm it up. One can't heat @CAPS1 up in a flash or else it could become tasteless, but once it is gradually heated it becomes easy to spread and very useful. This warm @CAPS1 is quick to mix with about anything and sticks to things all the same. My relationship has been sticky, sweet, and warming beyond compare, but nothing without a little work, or a little laughter.

         The @CAPS1 and Benefits of @CAPS2 is really an important thing in life. Laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy. If people laugh more often their days are more happier, lighter and much more shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more often. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element. Laughter can connect with many other nice elements, such as being glad or happy. I have once read a story about a little girl named @CAPS3 who liked to make people glad. And through gladness, people were made to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to laughing more, being happy, and of course smiling more. When you are felling down and some stranger for example smiles to you, you feel happier and maybe your mood is going to lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything was going up-side down. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very monotonous one, because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day is going to end like this.  @CAPS4 was also very grumpy this day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she has forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she has not even thought that if she had been more happier today, then everything will seem okay. Well, so, she still had to go to school, wanted she or not.  At school, the little teacher was merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even if it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the student had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The school work seemed endless to @CAPS4, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was visiting (especially the sick and old) begin to be happy, just like her. And when she had to go away from that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness of heart and being happy, the girl has left the most precious gift, being always happy which led to laughter more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter. And it was even enjoyable to stay in that place a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passer-by's always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of laughing. After the teacher has finished the story, @CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after the school was finished, @CAPS4 ran home to cheer everyone up. In the @TIME1, when everyone was finished with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. Seems like @CAPS4 has found a way to lead laughter into her household too. The story she had heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and all through her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which doesn't seem to big @CAPS1 to us has made @CAPS4's life more happy. I hope that this little factor can help you too.

 It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking "I'm gonna get back into that game!". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school.

JJ @NUM1                        Laughter  @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 say laughter isn't important in any relationship, but I think other wise. Laughter can always lighten up the mood no matter what it is, the laughing @MONTH1 only last a few seconds but that's alright as long as it's there. Maybe you would laugh because somethings funny or just because your tired. My cousin and I laugh for both those reasons every time we are together.  There are many stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. @CAPS1 of the best happened in @ORGANIZATION1! We have @CAPS1 pretty funny time in there. Like just the other day we went into @ORGANIZATION1 with one of our friends. Our friend went to go get @CAPS1 candy, and as she left me and my cousin ran way.  As we were running away and hiding or as we call it "being ninjas" we couldn't stop laughing the hole time. She tried calling us , and finding us, but we didn't answer or let her see us. Then my cousin and I saw her walking the other direction, so we ran up behind her and scared her. That is one of the many times that laughing was a part in my life.
<START>

One day I woke @CAPS6 staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp out my window I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath its to warm anyways as I woke @CAPS6 I walked out and ate some rice crispy s with my to sisters @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by "@CAPS1 foul" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name "@CAPS2". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to "stop faking it". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me she pays for my docter bills. 
<START>

 My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase speed and time. I wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the intentions to ever start a conversation, yet alone, @CAPS3 him. It had been a whole @DATE1 since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of @CAPS1. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all! If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be the best of friends for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, "@CAPS2 think now that @CAPS2're a teenager, @CAPS2 can do and act however @CAPS2 want?" Or the, "I'm your father, I deserve more respect!" @CAPS3, the funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings.  When my mother, sister and I arrived at the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I wanted to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me; even in the mist of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months of @DATE1 to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in @LOCATION1, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super nice, funny, and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes.  My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could @CAPS3 his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welded up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him.  The good thing is, an awkward moment never appeared. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door ; instead laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. @CAPS2 can count on his laugh to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing @CAPS2'll ever hear.  "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," including me and my father.

 The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS4 was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS4 had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Everynight the two would cuddle up next to eachother and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS1. @CAPS5 her name had come from. The seventh month had came along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS1 at my side.@CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didnt feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house and @CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full everytime we fed her, @CAPS4 wouldnt run with @PERSON1 anymore, @CAPS4 wouldnt talk, and @CAPS4 wouldnt smile. I knew something was wrong. We didnt know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME1, I couldnt find @CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panick spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. "@PERSON1," I looked at her straight into her eyes, "I know you can hear me." @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. "@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriends mother to look at her. We werent sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called a animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadnt gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 layed on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally after a day of crying next to her I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the insentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, i noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching her be in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet office, they took her inside and layed her on a table @CAPS5 I was told to hold onto her as they shot an overdose of anasthesia into her. it was only seconds before @CAPS4 was gone and everyone in the room was silent and I cried over her limp no longer smiling body.  We dug a hole and buried her under the tree @CAPS4 played under. "@CAPS1 my mama bear. @NUM2 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 you in heaven."

Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said "@CAPS6 go fishing." @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked "@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. "I think the fish will love this." I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad "@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18." @CAPS7 dad reply's "@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already." @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile "That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly." I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20

 @DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dads girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that i wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started..  The beging of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different color's of red's, green's, and orange. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumpin on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2 the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, We had no clue where we were.  First place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store. we go inside and theirs @CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye could see. Monster's, whitche's, and goblin's. We got side tracked by all the scary things I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy tells us hes never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah its just down a couple of streets. As we drive down the highway we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we are lost all over again so we find another covenant store up this really big hill. we didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside and had the clerk look up on his phone were we needed to go. As we waited all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search.   About twenty minutes later we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another covenant store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway I was like no no stay on this road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that we our funny adventure story.

Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person. Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems. After all toughs years had past by my mom and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states. As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport in @LOCATION1 my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport a small little red @ORGANIZATION1 started getting closer and closer driving towards my mom and I. The car was no further then forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each-others shoulders. When they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and I start walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him he griped me hard and didn't let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life.  Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home. The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there wasn't much talk in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the @LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states. When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always was acting like a clown he was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As days past by I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks past and my uncle @CAPS1 invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows. that day I experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true.In cunclusion laughter is one of the elements to life without I could not be happy.

 Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have became so close in the last @NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season.

The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time. The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better.

 Laughter is huge part of everyone's life. It's used to express several different emotions. It's used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier. People laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes.  Some people can communicate through laughter and know what the other is feeling. For instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep. So out of no where I began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter. Laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests; everyone laughs. I laugh more than others I'm sure of it. Laughter is a huge part of my life, honestly with out it my life would be boring and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad. I also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy so i get laughed at a lot. My family is a very close and hilarious family we make a lot of mistakes constantly everyday. For my great grandma's @DATE1 we were planning a surprise party. While we were planning it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE1. So we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Everyday my aunt acts in a ridiculous and funny way and so most of the time i laugh at her. She is always dancing at music on commercials or singing opera. My great grandma always eats foods that make her pass gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize that she is doing it. My great grandma also likes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far different then the ones today. I believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are. With out laughter i would not be as close to my friends. You can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not. It makes you comfortable around people and able to share things and act silly and not worry about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance. For example i was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike. I told him it wasn't very wise because i knew it was not possible for him to go through there with out getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway. So as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck. It took forever for us to get the bike out. As soon as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time. I was very upset with my cousin but as i was getting ready to yell and leave him he fell in the mud head first and it instantly changed my mood. Even still today i laugh about the matter even though i didn't think it was very funny at the time.  Even though laughter is good it can also be bad; @CAPS1 laughing at others while they are hurt and crying, or laughing at stupid ignorant pranks, or even laughing at people while they are making bad decisions. Decisions @CAPS1 drinking, drunk people are funny but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by laughing at them. Laughing at them makes them think that it's @CAPS2 to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh. So laughter is healthy but it is also unhealthy in a way.
<START>

So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better .
<START>

 Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about "over powered classes". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to "destroy" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. "@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!"my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along.

                  Laughter I have many friends. My friends and I are always doing silly things to have a good time, and pass the time. We are laughing all the time. There is not one day where we are together and we do not laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, blazing, @DATE1 day my friends, @PERSON2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 , all came over to my house. We were all bored, and hot, so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION3 said, "@CAPS1 don't we go swimming you guy's?" We all agreed. My friends and I could not agree on where to go swimming though. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was to crowded. We also, could not go to the lake, because it was too far, and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she could not give us a ride. @CAPS6 then said, "I know you guy's! @CAPS1 don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS2's house?" We all responded, "@CAPS3 let's do it!" A little after, the @CAPS4 went to the store nearest by, which was @ORGANIZATION1, to buy water balloons, and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. While us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @LOCATION1. The second team, and the best team, was @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and I. Both teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons, and water guns. The teams were on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they did not realize that we had the hose on our side. @PERSON4 chased @PERSON1 across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but @PERSON1 threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing. Then, @PERSON2 and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out. @PERSON2 was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. @PERSON2 tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first @CAPS5. It was time for @CAPS5 two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, "One! Two! Three!" @CAPS5 two had started. @LOCATION3 started chasing @PERSON3. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS6 wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON3 slipped first, but she took @LOCATION3 down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second @CAPS5. Now it was time for the final @CAPS5. The @CAPS5 that decided who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against who ever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION1. Then @LOCATION3 threw at @PERSON2, and after @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2. Who ever moved out of line lost. @PERSON1 was the first to lose. @PERSON3 had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. @LOCATION3 then water gunned @CAPS6 down. We walked another step closer. @PERSON4 and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON4 had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty so I beat her. We moved another step closer. @LOCATION3, and I easily soaked @PERSON3 down. My team had had won! We all cheered, then went back inside to dry off, and have some ice cream to celebrate my teams success. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with some good friends, imagination, and a lot of laughter. I believe that everyone should laugh on regular basis. There is no need for sadness of anger in life.

 Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a @CAPS2 brother should, but it is always a blessing t see him and have him over for the holidays its amazing how he found time during the @DATE1 to come and visit us. it was well fortunate because now i didn't have to hear him cry all the time on its too cold and wet out here. So it was pretty good but because it was the @DATE1 it was normally about the time i go out and hang out with my friends and girls and now that started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him i had to put my @CAPS2 brother first before anything.But then again every chance i got man i left and sneaked away to go see her. she was so beautiful so funny man she was s perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked up from the airport to the drive home talking making jokes about how much he changed how tight his cloths are. It was good we even stopped at burger-vile to get a couple burgers cause fat boy was so hungry all the time non stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god. As they came running towards he wasn't so prepared for it slowly still putting his bags down by the door he gets tackled and ruined over by a @NUM1 year old girl and a @NUM2 year old boy it was funny seeing them so happy and excited it was a surprise for them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night when we rented movies earlier that day to watch, as a family but like my family nothing ever happens accordingly or on time. You know when your having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catch's up to you ad running on low energy because you been excited all day to see your @CAPS2 brother and to share story's tell jokes and laugh having a good time you get sleepy and in some real need of some rest like sleep in your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time there put together in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up had a great time shared some laughs in the morning cracking joke nonstop. Talking hanging out i got to take my @CAPS2 brother to some party's of mine which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time cause before we left my mom was like okay we letting you g out don't get yourself into any shit @CAPS1 don't alright your dads going to b picking you up so don't be acting stupid look after your brother okay and right after i said yeah alright bet. i questioned it and was like what the hell? why do i have to look after my @CAPS2 brother he should be looking out for me. but i guess that's what made it funny. ever since then we had a good time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye at the airport to him. hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon.

 My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend.

 laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing.
<START>

 Have you ever laughed so hard that you started crying? Were you alone? Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3 mom. I went into @CAPS3 room and unplugged @CAPS3 little black phone from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flickered saying "@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1." I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. " @CAPS1, @PERSON1 you there?" I had asked hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. "@CAPS2, @CAPS3 grandpa just died."  @CAPS3 heart sank into @CAPS3 stomach. @CAPS3 eyes started to water up and @CAPS3 throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @CAPS3 voice was all shaky and rough. I said, "I'm sorry @PERSON1." and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS3 brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS3 grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, "there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS4. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS3 heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS3 mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS3 friend. Even though @PERSON1 will never see her grandpa @CAPS4 again she will always have him with her. Through memories, with in her heart, and by laughter.

 Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. "I think its the the jar on the left", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.

 Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, "@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, "We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part."  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, "@CAPS3!" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a "had to of been there moments." @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.

 For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, "I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. "@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2," my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, "@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town." All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, "@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,"@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, "keep to herself" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

 As warm @DATE1 days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1 and @PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our life's. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION1 season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 fan known to man. She was of coarse, all decked out in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION2.   Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON1 look alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @NUM1 or three inches into the @CAPS7. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and slowly moved over to where @PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, "@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back!  @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breath to tell @CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of sudden I hear this bang sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2 who were laughing along with @CAPS5. @PERSON3 finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS5 across the head and said, "@CAPS8't ever do that again." I'd say we had a better halftime show then the @ORGANIZATION1 did.  As the game ended, the weather changed and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS9 @CAPS1. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS11. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, open the door that led to the backyard and plopped her right down in the center of the pile.  @CAPS1's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @CAPS1 came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger. Whoever said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," was @PERCENT1 right.

                                                                        FUN @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I've had the same best @CAPS2 for about three years now. There are a lot of times where laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri-pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.

                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, "@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age.

 A great day for an adventure @CAPS5 my sister invited me to her christion school called @PERSON1 , @CAPS1 was a nice sunny day and then @CAPS1 turned in to a not so sunny day. Woke up first day of visiting my sister in her new school ,went to all her classes with her ,the teachers were kinda wired and so were her friends ,after second period in @PERSON1 we went to her @CAPS2.E class the teacher said to put on running shose besause we are going to run up a mountian, my sister had forgoten to put on her running shose so the teacher sent me and her to go get them after we got the shose the class was already a quarter of a mile away from the school so me and my sister desided to take a short cut so we took the off road "the seanic root". We had ran down a hill and @CAPS1 was really a steep , my sister got half way down the hill and slid on her butt all the way down after she went I went so I ran down the hill faster then I had ever ran in my life and I hit the pavement at the bottom I was like a tumble-weed in a huricane my sister helped me up and we started running tword the class and they were in "shock" of what me and my sister looked like my sister looked like she had just got done playing in the mud me on the other hand looked like I got hit by a truck and my face was covered in dirt, @CAPS3 after me and my sister got back we decided to get cleaned up, so we went to the showers the showers at @PERSON1 are similer to the ones in @CAPS4.H.S but with shower curtins the shower that I had used the curtin had came off this medel hook and I wasnt being smart and used a plastic stepping stool the ground was still wet from @CAPS5 I had took a shower and the stool sliped and my pinkey got cought on the hook and I sliced @CAPS1 open on a main vain in my pinky I started getting light-headed and I passed out my sister and her friends took me to my sisters room and put a band-ade on @CAPS1 @CAPS5 i was still passed out.

  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in.

  When you laugh, what are you thinking about? Who are you with? What are you doing ? When you were three you laughed because someone went, "@CAPS1-a-boo"and they contorted their face. When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and wasn't wearing clothes that were "in". By the time your twenty-three you laugh with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party. But when you find yourself at thirty-three your laughing while your husband is wrestling your five year old. Well about three years back my brother and I finally figured out how to have a relationship.   The @PERSON1 family has always been complicated. When we tell people how we are related, their response is always, "@CAPS2...What? Start over!", so we try to avoid the topic. My brother @PERSON2 has lived in @LOCATION2 his whole life with his mother and step @CAPS3, so neither our @CAPS3 or I really had a close relationship with him. Although it wasn't our dads fault, we only saw @PERSON2 maybe twice a year. In those two times a year, @PERSON2 and my sister @PERSON3, would always pick on me, hide from me and laugh at me because I couldn't do what they could. I used to hate it when he was coming down, because I knew I would spend most of that time crying and getting in trouble for things I didn't do. When three kids grow up together they find that they like each other better when they get along. My brother wasn't so mean to me anymore and he figured out that we were on the same side against the common enemy: @CAPS3. Our relationship has always grown around laughter, we get along because we are able to make jokes about one another everyday and know that it means nothing. Its our way of showing we care about each other, sometimes we laugh at other people and sometimes we laugh at ourselves. Now that my brother is off at college, we actually miss each other, and the key to our relationship is the laughter we share.  When my brother found that he actually liked me, he taught me everything about video games and helped me, we were not only on the same team in the video game, but also in real life. Summer @DATE1 my brother and I were sitting at home, bored because @CAPS3 was at work and @PERSON2 didn't have a car in @LOCATION1. We decided to play all the video games at least once throughout that endless day. That challenge didn't last long because the first and last game we played that day was @CAPS4 @NUM1. We started off just figuring out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour. Then we started playing just to see who's team won, we started making jokes about each others players and we gave all the bad players, mean, really weird names, we laughed through the whole game. Then to make things more interesting we got into making our own characters and building a fantasy draft. @PERSON2, being a guy, came up with the grossest names and made the players look either really scary or really funny, he stacked their stats so they had an overall team average of @PERCENT1 in everything. I, being a girl, made all my guys really hot and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats to what I thought was reasonable, depending on their good looks, so my team average was only @PERCENT2. From the moment of the tip, to the the moment we looked at the final stats for the game, we were laughing. Every time the announcer said one of our players names in that basketball context, it was so wrong but so funny, "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 for two". When both teams made every shot and then by some chance somebody missed one, we made so many comments and jokes. By the time @CAPS3 had gotten home, he thought something was wrong because we were crying so hard from laughing, that our tan carpet had turned brown . Even through dinner, when we had calmed down, @PERSON2 would say something only I would know what it meant and we would just burst out laughing and @CAPS3 would look at us with a dumbfounded expression. Looking back I wouldn't trade anything for that day.  Now @PERSON2 and I sometimes bring up that day when we start playing a sports game or were just talking on the phone. We laugh and use context to make fun of each other. Ya you could say its not a very normal relationship, but that's how we know we love each other, because truth is, I don't even like video games, I only ever play a video game when he wants to. So since that day we have become closer, we don't fight, and we actually stand up for each other. So who ever said, " Laughter is the shortest distance between to people." is right.

 It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @CAPS1 and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says "keep it on @NUM3 wheels". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree, @NUM5 weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1 the engine for @NUM8 and the rear end for @NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2 and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that.

I think that laughter is a very important part of life and sometimes it helps people when there down.One time I was with my cousin and she was having a bad day she was stressed, upset and she didn't know what to do so she came over and she got real emotional and I told her it was okay to cry.Then after a while when she calmed down I told her that life wasn't always going to be easy that a lot of people said life was life a box a chocolate you just gotta eat @NUM1 at a time some @MONTH1 be sweet and the others might not be so good, but I told her that life was more like a jar of jalapenos what you do now @MONTH1 burn your butt tomorrow and she just laughed and right then and there she smiled and laughed so I knew she was going to be okay she just needed some time to cool off and be okay and then after all that she had a good day she stayed the @TIME1 and we just watched movies and listened to music and that's why i think its good to laugh and besides you lose calories that way ha-ha.

  Laughter is important  The last two weeks of school, and I was told the best news ever. My mom had told me that I would be flying to @LOCATION1, by myself. I was excited because I haven't seen my family in awhile. Even though @CAPS1 been on a plane a couple of times, I was still scared, I have never flew by myself, so this was going to be something extremely new. Even though I was excited and scared at the same time, I just kept thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I have never seen or heard from before. School seemed to be going by very slow, and I was very anxious. When two weeks passed I already had my bags packed and was ready to go. My mom was trying not to cry, but she did anyways. I walked threw the metal detectors then down a long hall way, finally I had got on the plane. On the plane ride I was thinking about meeting my real dad, and that's all I was thinking about the whole time I was on the plane. I landed in @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 pm that day. I was glad too because I was tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. Me and my sister didn't have a close relationship, so it was kind of awkward. She started talking about times when we were younger, and how we had fun. Since I was in @LOCATION1 I wanted to see a lot of my family members, most of my family members already knew that I was in town, news travels fast. When my aunt's seen me they were in shock, they said that I had grew so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best moments ever. I met so many people, especially family friends, it was a amazing because I even met some of my moms school friends. Days after, I had got a text message from one of my sisters that I have never seen or met before, and she was so happy to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me, and spend some time together, so we made plans. I was really nervous, because the only time that I have seen my dad was when I was really young. That was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I was finally going to meet them, I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and my cousin just so it wouldn't be awkward. We decided to meet at my grandmas house. I haven't seen her in awhile, and unfortunately she wasn't there. When my dad got there, I didn't know what to do, I didn't recognize him, or even my other sister. We gave each other hugs. When we got into the house we were all quiet, and all my dad could say was "@CAPS2" because I grew so much. He then started talking about the silly little things I did when I was a little girl, and it made us all laugh. All we did was laugh, and it made me cry a little. If it wasn't for laughing my relationship with my dad couldn't have been better.

so one time my friends chad, justin and i ding dong ditched this old man. the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing. so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house, banged on his door and ran. it was so funny cuz when we got back from running we went to our friend taylors house and we where sittting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door. at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylors room, and thats when it happend... the funniest shit ever, the old mad just started scearming and banging on the door then he yelled "come out boys what are you afraind of?!" and we just crack up in laughter. well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that, waking up taylors mom. wel we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time. and we denied it was us, but it totally was so we couldnt help but laugh in his ugly face. he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapest. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasnt fooling anyone. by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didnt know what the hell he was talking about. so we got off scotfree. it was funny and awesome.

 What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, "I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst." @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself.

 Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. "@CAPS4" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. "@CAPS6"@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday.

 There is a difference between right and wrong. Most of us learn from it and most of us don't. We all have a choice either to face of @CAPS3 we have done wrong, or just lie about it and get into even more trouble then you already are. Ever wondered when you are about to do something wrong and you don't think first? Well this was one of those times when I wasn't thinking first. I was nine year's old, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I, were playing at the park joking around, playing on the old rusted blue swing set, just having a good time. Nothing much to do at a park but shoot hoop's, run around, go on the monkey bar's that have ton's of bacteria on them, down the drenched slide, and play tag if we had the energy. @ORGANIZATION1 see's two rusted broke down car's that look like they have been there for centuries. @ORGANIZATION1 say's out of his dumb brain of his " We should go over there and throw rocks at those car's you guy's." I shack my head, nodding at @ORGANIZATION1 with a wide grin on my face. @PERSON1 say's with zero tolerance for any negatively say's " @CAPS1 we shouldn't those car's are owned by somebody. How would you feel if someone idiot kid's came and wrecked your car's?" I think for a second, well he does have a point. I would flip my chicken if some idiot kid's did that to my car. We are all looking at each other thinking @CAPS3 to do. Sixteen minutes go by and still nothing. With my idiot brain i say " @CAPS2's, do those car's don't belong to anyone? They don't even look like then can move, look's like they have been sitting there sense the dinosaurs were here." @PERSON1 walks off and mumbles to him self " @CAPS3 idiot kid's I already know they're going to get into trouble." @ORGANIZATION1 and I look at each other like we just saw a ghost. We finally start heading towards the rusty broken down car's. On the way there with @ORGANIZATION1's clumsy feet trip's over a piece of wood.  Finally get to the two rusty broken down car's, I pick up a rock. I think for a second to ask me is this okay? should I be doing this? Just with pure pressure and the guilty conscience, I threw the rock. One after the other, just kept on throwing rocks, pipes, car parts, logs, and beating it with a gigantic metal pipe. @ORGANIZATION1 and I leave, now we are exhausted we take a break and look at @CAPS3 we have done to those rusty broken down car's. The two car's look like the just been hit with a tornado. @ORGANIZATION1 and I just start laughing our head's off. We kept on laughing almost until we were about to wet our selves. There was @CAPS1 one around and @CAPS1 one saw us. At least that's @CAPS3 we thought.  Was about four day's later and back at the park @PERSON1 and I, and @CAPS1 sign of @ORGANIZATION1. About to go home from the park a tall, blond, old, big feet, lady walk's up to us and asks us out of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 " @CAPS4 do you to live?"  We were just kid's at the time and I say without even thinking one tiny bit " I leave right down the street, it's the second to the last house. I'll show you if you would like?" The lady with big feet reply's " @CAPS5 that would be great, thanks." @PERSON1 and I start walking home just wondering why did that lady want to know @CAPS4 we live? Get around the block and we see that lady's car in front of my house. @PERSON1 and I look at each other and I knew @CAPS3 he was thinking. @PERSON1 was thinking that I'm screwed.   The lady with the big feet ended up being the owner of those two rusty broken down car's. I didn't know @CAPS3 to say or do. Just the thought going through my mind that was telling me I'm screwed. Never been so grounded and whooped hard in my life. If there are some lesson's of @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, and I have learned it would be don't touch anything that is not yours, be respectful of @CAPS3 is not yours, treat everything with respect even if it's not yours, and not to be idiot kid's again. This has shown @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I right from wrong, telling the truth, face @CAPS3 we have done wrong, and think about doing something before your actions get's you in trouble.

  Dozey off into space, relaxed as I could be in a hot stuffy room. @CAPS1 is laying next to me, both thinking of things we could do. Nothing is coming to mind. We both decided that it was to hot do anything outside, and nothing was on tv. We thought we were just going to be laying in bed all day, roting away in the heat. But then @CAPS1 comes up with this idea to play some video games. @CAPS6 we turn up some music, blast the streo. Put in some @CAPS2 Of @CAPS3 and start killing people. @CAPS6 were killing people, whipping butt if i could say. Then @CAPS1 says "@CAPS5 im getting really tired, plus it's gettig really warm." @CAPS6 then i try fixing the ac. @CAPS6 im working on the the ac and are is just laying in bed. Time went bye, seems like it was taking forever for the day to end. We had nothing to do. We were stuck. Then @CAPS1 started telling me a joke. I was a chessy one but it still made me laugh. @CAPS6 here were sitting on her bed telling each other some jokes to pass time away. After awile the jokes get old, now were sitting on her bed again. Falling asleep because there's nothing else we can do. Music is off, window is open, @CAPS6 all you can hear is the cars driving by one the street. Out of no where @CAPS1 farts, and it wa snot no girly fart. It was loud and stinky. Right away I start to laugh. While she is getting enbarested, I don't remeber why but then I farted to. She started to crack up laughing. Her face was truning red. @CAPS6 we both started farting back and forth, reminder we were in the sixth grade. But nothing was as funny as it was when what is bpout to happen in my life. It's @CAPS1's turn to fart, and she is getting all ready than she farts. But this was not like any other one! She stopped laughing right away, looked at me with a frown on her poor little face and said"@CAPS10 i think i just pooped my pants!" I started laughing @CAPS6 freking hard, i started to cry. IT was that bad. You could smell it to. @CAPS6 she starting walking to the bathroom, and all i hear is "@CAPS10 i just pooped my freking pants!!"

 It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.
<START>

 I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live.  @PERSON1 and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON1 up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director's face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness.

 Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bonding with others,adreneline, the helping of releasing tension, and the joking that is made on a daily basis around you. Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, " laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces. Share the laughter.

 Laughter is the best way to bring people closer together. It creates a bond that makes you feel a little more comfortable and secure. Life would be sad and depressing if there was no such thing as laughter. Everyone has a different type of laugh some peoples are loud, quiet,weird, or funny.But our laughter is what makes us who we are.  There are so many effects in the process of laughing.Your laugh can have such a strong effect on your body that it can cause your eyes to become a little teary. Sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt. When somethings really funny I usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing.That's one of the effects that happens to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke,or even a simple mistake.My family always makes me laugh.When we have party's were always laughing and cracking up jokes.One of the jokes that my cousins said is that my aunts baby was so white that it look like a came out of la lechera. Lechera is a @CAPS1 word.  Another thing that also made me laugh is when i went to my cousins house. We were watching a movie and i had to go use the restroom so i went and when i came out she jump out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing i was scared but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere and i never expected her to do that. I think of laughing as a gift. It is something that can always brighten our day.I love to laugh and there's so many unforgettable moments were i almost laughed till i peed my pants.I think the people with the best personality are the people who can make someone else laugh.

A @CAPS1 Laughter    @CAPS2 you hear a child laugh what do you think? Do you think peace and happyness or what do you think? @CAPS2 I hear a child laugh I think of my little sister. @CAPS2 were outside playing peter pan or inside playing doll's, she just brights up like a light and I can see her happyness. It's not just my sisters laugh that brings me joy it's everyones! I do think a @CAPS1 laugh is the most unique though! @CAPS2 you hear your child, niece, nephew, or grandchild laugh you should hear there happyness.    A laugh changes @CAPS2 you grow older. I remember hearing my sisters and brothers laugh at the simplest things @CAPS2 they were younger. But now they never do, now they laugh at sick and disgusting jokes and they laugh @CAPS2 someone gets teased. But thats not my case. I am the one who laughs @CAPS2 someone does something sill like on americas funiest home videos. But a child laughs @CAPS2 you make a funny face or @CAPS2 an animal does something funny. They laugh at the littlest things.     To me a smile is just a silent laugh. I remember hearing a saying "A smile is worth a thousand words" and I think that goes for laughter too! Even though there is no sound in a smile, there is sound waiting to come out of that person! I know for a fact that @CAPS2 I was younger I was abused and so @CAPS2 ever something good happened which was hardly ever but I had a huge smile on my face then some one would do something funny and I would try not to laugh but I only lasted like @NUM1 seconds, then I would start laughing so hard that I would start to cry!      Theres this one specific time that was the high light of my life. One day I was just hanging out with my sister linda and we were playing dolls. My dad had happened to walk in and he accidently stepped on one of the dolls. Linda started to cry cause the arm had been broken off. But @CAPS2 she started to cry my dad started hopping on one foot and held the other then he fell on his butt. I laughed so hard that afternoon! Then later that day he took me and linda to the store to each buy one new doll!     Again I @MONTH1 say that a @CAPS1 laughter is the most beautiful thing on earth! Just for some reason it heals the soul! You @MONTH1 start off on a bad day then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house to your child laughing. Then your day gets suddenly better! I wish I were a child again so i could rewind and make things so much better than @CAPS2 I was little!      I started off in a bad situation but now I am a smart intelegent young lady! Every laugh is unique in there own way cause every one is different. Just because you grow older doesn't mean your laugh does. But every laugh does change in some way I'm not sure how but it happens as you grow older! You laugh at different things and you laugh not as much as you used to!

 Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness.

 Laughter is one of the most impotent things in life to have around. even if from a simple joke to something that was unbelievable that hap-end to make a grate event in time to share on in history of family members. This helps you threw hard times or just makes somebody day better for them and puts a smile on there face, or gives them a joke to say to somebody else to continue a chain of laughter thew people. Sometimes it can be the most embarrassing thing that people remember about u but in the end the other person that laughs at you for your indecent probably did something like that a long time a go so in the end there laughing at them selves to and don't even realize it. I remember on my fifteenth birthday my grandma toke the hole family out to dinner at a chines restaurant. It was quiet except for the adults discussing what they should order form the family meals. I was siting by me sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink, well her mined was on other things because out of no were all u heard was "they have no fricken chicken". Every one busted up laughing at her even the waitresses son that was standing behind the both and his mother. It made every ones day because it wasn't the best of days at the time. But u could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at her self to her comment to the table was "i thought i said it in my head", i looked at here and said "no u didn't" so she just shrugged about it.  To this day when ever we go to a chines restaurant my mom looks at here and "says they got your fricken chicken"so she looks at here and "says will that ever die"we all looked at here and said" no its going to be passed down to your children they'll here about there mothers fricken chicken day".It was that bad of a indecent that she gets up set that it wont go away but it still gives every one else a laugh. even though it was so long ago that it happened are parents joke that its going to be her wedding toast it went kinda like this" as long as you give her, her fricken chicken you @CAPS1 will last forever" it was not the nicest of comments to be said about that day but it was still funny to the rest of us. this is something that will last in the family for years to come ,and hopefully will be passed down in the generations to come.Even if she doesn't want it to be just think in time ens-ted of us telling every one about the incident she will tell them her self and just laugh about it because it was just that much of an out off nowhere thing to happen. We still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them. But those are story's for another time and day you never know what could happen. just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible.  So if your having a not so good of a day,u never know what could happen to give u a smile and a laugh even if your the one that makes every one laugh. So just think of something that makes u laugh and tell the people that are special in your life about it to give them a laugh and make there day a little better then most.Even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time. When we all were little and crying that was always the cure for some of the worst things even though u grow up it docent mean u cant laugh or that it means different things then it used to, when your down u need to laugh to feel better about your self don't let people put you down.

 I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didnt have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of.

 Everyone in life has siblings that they grew up with and that they love unconditionally, but for some of us, we didn't know our siblings until later in life. I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others. I had what I like to call a @PERSON1 who in actuality in my biological father. Up until I was seven years old I thought that my dad @PERSON2 was my quote on quote "real dad", but one evening I heard my mother down stairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad. I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact the one on the other @DATE1 of the line was my biological father. The moment I heard your son deserves better than this I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that @PERSON2 was my dad but now this new figure in my life is claiming to be. My mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it had turned out my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad, my mom would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child's support. During this little story that she was unveiling I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world. Over the next eight years of my life I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email address's trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't up until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me, named @PERSON3. He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other @DATE1. On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me, he chanced upon a question of what my last name was. I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the @DATE1 I told him. All of the sudden a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named @CAPS1. My mind started to reel over this sudden question. @PERSON3 started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister @CAPS2 who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for. Almost before I @CAPS3 think to ask the question of how; he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother. As it had turned out, she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her. @PERSON3 asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone. I to was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next @DATE1. On the @DATE1 that I met my sister, @CAPS4 mom had come to pick me up to take me to her house. As we were driving so many thought were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car. When we finally arrived at her house @PERSON4 who is @CAPS4 mom, urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister that I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was. During the next four long nerve racking hours, my sister and I played @NUM1 questions with each other to get to know one another. After doing this we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother. By the @DATE1 we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh (that every one hated) and that to made us hit the floor laughing. At one point in time her mom had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we didn't and by the @DATE1 of the @DATE1 we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left. @CAPS2 and I connected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that @DATE1 to even now; every time we see each other we giggle and smirk. Since we found each other or in my case her brother found me; I have gone to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another.

 We couldn't control our selves, our eyes watering, and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move. I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class.  We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON1 and I did in @CAPS2 grade.

 It all started one @DATE1 after school, when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go to my house. We were not planning to walk home, we missed the bus. @CAPS6 we began to walk down the ramp from the high school. While we were walking we got hungry. @CAPS6 we went to the @ORGANIZATION1. We ordered a @CAPS1 and some drinks. @PERSON1 decided to shake up my soda @CAPS13 hand it to me. Me not knowing what's up @CAPS6 I asked, "@CAPS2 you shake up my soda?" @CAPS3 said, "@CAPS4 I @CAPS2 here's mine, let's trade." I @CAPS2 and ended up opening the one @CAPS3 shook for real. " That was a lil devious!" I said. @CAPS6 when I stood up to chase her and poor soda on her, I tripped and fell on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON1 was cracking up with laughter @CAPS13 said, "@CAPS5 @CAPS6 stupid, who falls over a stump!" @CAPS6 I got up from the ground and pulled all of the thorns out, @CAPS13 continued to walk home. We were already more than half way to my house, when @PERSON1 decided to hit me in the shin and run. Of course not learning my lesson the first time, I chased her. I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and @CAPS13 fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to loose it when @PERSON1 was laughing too dramaticly. Out of @CAPS14 were, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. @CAPS3 ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew @CAPS3 @CAPS2 lock it, was because I ran @CAPS6 fast to bust in. before I @CAPS2 I turned the knob, but it didn't open though. Instead the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, why, well because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @CAPS13 headed inside to shower. @PERSON1 asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. @CAPS12 I told her what really happen, @CAPS13 @CAPS3 will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering I asked @PERSON1, "@CAPS7 you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?" @CAPS3 replied, "@CAPS9 I'm down let's go!" @CAPS6 I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot. First @PERSON1 tried and hit four out of six. That's pretty good for being a girl. @CAPS6 I went to replace the four bottle @CAPS3 shot. As I was doing @CAPS6 @CAPS3 shot me in the butt."@CAPS11!" I yelled and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I @CAPS2 was swore like @CAPS14 other, and aimed my gun to @PERSON1 to get her back. @CAPS3 was quick to run upstairs and grab my @NUM1. @CAPS3 said with a freaked out voice, "@CAPS12 you come any closer I'll throw this out the window!" @CAPS13 I said to her, "@CAPS14 you won't, you know how much I paid for that!" @CAPS15 my luck shot her in the leg. Well turns out @CAPS3 wasn't lieing bout throwing it out the window. It was ok though, because I could get another one. That @DATE1 with @PERSON1 was great, but @CAPS3 laughed at me most of the time. I didn't care, whatever makes her happy. I really @CAPS7 like making her smile. I delt with a lot of pain that day, and lost a shirt with poop. It's all good though, it's going to be a great memory when we look back on this day.

I could just laugh to death. someone said. I sacned the area. "@CAPS37?" I said. "@CAPS1 here son." I looked @CAPS1 the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue. There was the sorce of the voice i had herd. @CAPS35 was only an old man probualy homeless by the looks of him. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a riped shirt under a worn jacket. "@CAPS3, @CAPS31 @CAPS33 a little lost"The old man said. "@CAPS4, I'm @CAPS73 lost" said @PERSON1. His pocket started to vibrate. @PERSON1 reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell. He fliped @CAPS35 open and read: @CAPS31 going to be here soon? Tommey typed: ya bro just going onto @CAPS2 ave now. Message sent. @PERSON1 started to climb the steps. "@CAPS5 @CAPS31 later old man" said @PERSON1 as he dashed of to meet his friends. @PERSON1 saw his friends in site @CAPS62 were all standing outside of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 bakery. "@CAPS3,guys @CAPS33 @CAPS35's @PERSON1!" @CAPS34 @PERSON2. @PERSON2 ran at @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 scuped her @CAPS1 and spun her around one before puting her @CAPS66 @CAPS19. @CAPS62 proceeded to walk over to the group. "@CAPS37 took @CAPS31 so long dude" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. "@CAPS11, @CAPS63 the short cut i took turned out to be, @CAPS73 to short" @PERSON1 repiled. "@CAPS12 don't mind him he's just in a bad mood" said @CAPS13. "@CAPS14" replied @CAPS9 @CAPS10. "@CAPS3, guys can we go into the @CAPS18 @CAPS19's toy store!!" inqured @PERSON2. "@CAPS20 that's fine" replied @CAPS13 @CAPS22. The group proceeded @CAPS19 @CAPS2 avenue @CAPS24 turned right onto @ORGANIZATION1 street, @CAPS24 another right onto @CAPS25 avenue. The store was located halfway @CAPS19 in the middle of other boutiques. "@CAPS26 were here" said @PERSON2 as she spun around around from excitement. "@CAPS24 let's go in" said @CAPS9 @CAPS10. "@CAPS30 old greblin!" said @PERSON2. "shh mu ha ha ha" @CAPS31 got told said @CAPS13. "@CAPS32" he grumbled. Once inside the store @CAPS35 was like somone turned @CAPS9 the lights @CAPS9 bright. @CAPS73 only that but the store was filled from top to bottom with @CAPS38 but toys. The toys ranged from small to large to huge. There were all sorts of diffrent types. "@CAPS33" @CAPS34 @PERSON2.

"@CAPS3, don't be mean to her!" said @CAPS13 as she picted @CAPS1 a monester an flung @CAPS35 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10. @CAPS35 missed and hit @PERSON1. @PERSON1 flung @CAPS35 @CAPS66 at @CAPS9 @CAPS10.

I tend to always get myself into awkward situations with the people i love, but that's just life right? When your a kid you tend to be dramatic about every little thing, an to those who love you @DATE1 are trying to teach you something @DATE1 or lead you the right way. Or maybe that was just me, haha? I moved out of my dads, with a horrible bang. I wanted to live life my way, which was only pushing the people i needed most away. I realized that a little too late. But again, that's just life right? Just about @DATE1 i finally "rekindled the flame" with my dad again. It was the hardest thing to do, considering my step mom hates me. @DATE1 that's obviously never going to change. So that's just something i'll have to deal with. My dad @DATE1 i still had the most awkward relationship, till about a few months ago when we had gone on a fishing trip together. Standing there, casting away there was nothing said. We both consider ourselfves fairily humorous people, but even our jokes wern't breaking through the ice. We finally started making conversation @DATE1 he started to tell me about when i was a kid going @DATE1 visiting my mom for the first time, then coming back to my grandmas @DATE1 calling her a......bad word...but i wont say which one. My dad hasnt every really cursed around me before, i guess that's time away for you. It was pretty funny all these stories he was telling me, @DATE1 the way he was explaing them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both. @DATE1 really brought us back together again.

 Have you ever laughed so hard that you couldn't really breathe or you started to cry? well I can tell you that I do that all the time and that laughter is a big part of my life. I remember when my family and I all went out to eat for dinner one night. My grandpa wanted to go out to chinse food in @LOCATION1, so my mom, little brother, my grandma, grandpa, my friend @CAPS1 and I all went out to the chinse @CAPS2. That ngith was memorible because that was the night that we had the whole table laughing at @CAPS1 and I. When @CAPS1 and I got done orering our food the waiter brought us our appitzers and thats when the trears and laughter came out. It was ten minuates of talking to @CAPS1 about this boy that she liked and when she said the name my crab puff went launching toward her i couldn't help but laugh so loud, and hard.  As @CAPS1 and I sat there and laughed about what had just happened, I had seen that @CAPS1 couldn't really open her mouth because she was laughing to hard and her cheeks hurt from laughing, she ended up drooling into the little sauce bowl that at soy sauce in it, and when seeing that I new that I couldn't help but not tell her at all. The night came to an end when @CAPS1 ended up dumping her water all over the waiters son. I had to appologized to the waiter that night and her son to. Her son said that it was ok because it happens to him all the time. Laughter is a big part of peoples lives because laughing can make you happy, bring smiles to peoples faces, and make memories.

 This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1 so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on "@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, "@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest". I not thinking about @CAPS1 said, "That's easy!" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. @CAPS1 happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like.

 Laughter is a part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of happiness and a connection with others. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON2. I went to him because we could talk about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We have been friends since we were in elementary. Because of laughter in our relationship and memories of days when we laughed, it has made this relationship last. I have been mad at my friend and he has been mad at me. But because of all those good times we have had laughing . We are still great friends.Here is a time when laughter was in one of my friend relationships. @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house. It was a @DATE1. We were listening to music and talking about stuff. We didn't do much that day. Except the thing that they were about to do. Out of nowhere @PERSON2's little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @PERSON1 gets up and does the same. @PERSON2 then gets up too- it was something I didn't expect to happen. They chose a certain song and made a dance for it. The whole time this was happening we were all having a good time. They all looked funny doing their dance. After a while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired. But we kept on laughing because @PERSON2's nephew kept on dancing. They danced to this song a few other times that @DATE1. It was still funny to me the last time as it was the first time they did it. Laughter connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I mostly remember because it was funny. I remember it like if it was just last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That is why I think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger. I have this story to prove it.

  Middle school was a challenging environment. Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment, but a maturing social environment as well. The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground. Without the skill to be able to laugh it off, I would fear for anyone's mental well being in that environment.  Throughout my first @NUM1 years in middle school, I struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain, making for a severe toll @CAPS1 not only my self-esteem, but my academics as well. The stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades continuing a cycle resulting in even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life, my outlook had become so grim. I wondered how I would make it through the rest my school years.  Everyday I had the pleasure of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder, attempting to supplement their growing self-esteem and inflating egos; @CAPS1 some days even those who I previously believed to be my friends joined in with them. Except for a few trusted companions, it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults.  Being made fun of daily had continued until I realized something; That laughter is key in social survival. Without laughter there was no way I could have survived those school years. After this revelation I was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well. I was able to take the the cacophony and learn with it, taking it as critique to better myself. Through laughter and their jarring remarks I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence, as well as make new, better friends and come to peace with others, while maintaining the the hurt I experienced earlier to be "popular" without having to make fun out of those who were like who I used to be; @CAPS2 a win-win scenario.  Laughter is key in any situation, whether it be a conversation with a friend, or experiencing the penned up frustrations of immature adolescents. From laughter I learned a great lesson, one that I hope everyone has not learned should. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and pleasurable life.

 I have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad @CAPS2, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter along to accompany that sincere smile. I enjoy walking down the street on a nice, beautiful @CAPS2 and walking by locals I know that smile, laugh, and give a little wave to show that they are enjoying the @CAPS2 as much as I am. Walking past someone I @MONTH1 not know also has its positives. One look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good @CAPS2 or a bad @CAPS2. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it is a good @CAPS2 or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get @CAPS12 I meet someone and I know that we connected great. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. I can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions.  @CAPS12 I first met my friend @CAPS1, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 double date with our friend and my cousin. @CAPS12 the guys first picked us, I got into the car and the first thing that I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than what I would have ever thought of. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. Pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away.  Just the other night , @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @PERSON1 and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each others company @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 decided to go to the store and buy some things using @CAPS1's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, @CAPS1 and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 run into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared and nervous about something. @CAPS4 wouldn't look at us, so @PERSON1 told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was no where in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting @CAPS1 to get mad and say something to @CAPS4, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car and said, "@CAPS11't worry, the car is fine." @CAPS12 he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in the state of shock and so @CAPS12 I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well and in less than @NUM1 seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy, was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @CAPS1 asked me the question I was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces.

Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family.

 Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather "unique" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH1 feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS1 things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is "let go laughing." @CAPS1 go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more you feel better overall. You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing.

 There is @CAPS28 more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to @CAPS10 heart. In @CAPS1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like @CAPS10 are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is @CAPS28 but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we @CAPS6't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire @CAPS2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell @CAPS10 of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a @DATE1 and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! "@CAPS3 up, @PERSON1," @CAPS4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows @CAPS11 better. The one dog eats rocks for @CAPS5 sakes. But @DATE2, @CAPS15 has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy.  "I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if @CAPS15 knows your here and they are not done." "@CAPS6't worry, I'll help @CAPS10, and we'll get them done before your sister notices."  @CAPS7, we are off. @CAPS4 wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. @CAPS7, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. @CAPS4's sister sounds like @CAPS15 is waking up but @CAPS7 snorts and the noise ends. @CAPS7 we get back to work. When we got done, we @CAPS21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We @CAPS21 were tired and our hearts were still pounding. @CAPS7, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to @CAPS3 up. @CAPS7 another day, I come over and we are @CAPS21 really hungry. We @CAPS21 haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. "@CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat," @CAPS15 asked me. "I @CAPS6't know. @CAPS8 do @CAPS10 wanna eat, " I replied back. "I @CAPS6't know, " the endless cycle. But, @CAPS7 my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. @CAPS4 fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. "@CAPS9!!" I'm delighted, " @CAPS9!!" we @CAPS21 shout in joy of the idea.  We get everything together, and begin making @CAPS9. Now, @CAPS21 of @CAPS16 are really, "great cooks," so when we were faced with "who should flip the @CAPS9", it was a @CAPS11 brain-er.  "@CAPS10 do it!" "@CAPS11, @CAPS10 do it!!" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and @CAPS7 I did indeed, "do it," for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips @CAPS9. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many "stupid pancake's" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. @CAPS7 came another @DATE1, and this time @CAPS4 had a surprise. "I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire @CAPS2!" I thought for a moment, "@CAPS14." @CAPS15 immediately dragged me to her computer where @CAPS15 had them down loaded. I thought to myself, "are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot.  The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. "@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes!"  I paused the none existent thought in my head, "@CAPS8 did he say?" "@CAPS16 @CAPS19 of how her blood tastes," @CAPS15 looked at me. I crack up laughing, "@CAPS20. I thought he said, @CAPS16 @CAPS19 @CAPS8 her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!"  @CAPS21 of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with @CAPS16 that. We finish watching a couple episodes and @CAPS7 my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but @CAPS4 comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. "@CAPS23 I'll talk to @CAPS10 later, @CAPS4, " I say heading down the steps "@CAPS25, see @CAPS10 at school tomorrow."  "@CAPS26. And see @CAPS10 next @DATE1!" I yell from the car window. @CAPS15 yells back, "@CAPS27!" @CAPS28 is more fun than that, a friends house on a @DATE1 @TIME1. Especially with a couple of crazies things, like me and my buddy, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, @CAPS9 that stick to the pan, andVampire @CAPS2 with my poor hearing.

 "@PERSON1, @CAPS1 up! It's almost time you to go to school!"  @CAPS2 mom yelled at fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and yawing boy. That's me. Today is a first day of @CAPS2 first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, that's why I had to move a school too. I woke up and took a shower and wore @CAPS2 school uniforms with exciting and nervous mind, because I didn't know anyone from @CAPS6 new school. When I arrived to the school, students who are same age as me started to scream out loud for sadness of school days that are coming up or excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school. I shook @CAPS2 head off and started to concentrate finding @CAPS2 classroom. '@CAPS3 hah! There it is.' @CAPS4, I found @CAPS2 classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the "new" kid to @CAPS6 school. I sat alone and waited for teacher to come. During I was waiting, I put @CAPS2 head down and slept a little bit with no smile on @CAPS2 face. Suddenly, teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, "@CAPS5 sit down and be quiet!" @CAPS6 teacher must be the most strict teacher I've never seen. While teacher was writing down something on the whiteboard, the students were trash-talking about the first sight of the teacher. It was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time. For example, I knew a kid who went to a private school and transferred to a public school. I had a same class with him and I was his partner. Since I didn't know him very well, I started to ask questions about him. At first, he answered back nicely to me and I thought, 'We could be close friends from @CAPS6 class.' @CAPS7 it was wrong. He started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly. Also, he had weirdest perfume smell that he thought it was cool to wear. @CAPS5 thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight. @CAPS8 arguing with other friends, he stopped coming school and now we don't even know where he is at. Like @CAPS6, it shows that the first sight is really important to have in relationships with other people. When I heard that the first sight is really important from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed @CAPS2 mind to an open mind such as having a smile on @CAPS2 face. I though, ' I shouldn't be like that kind of teacher's first sight. Maybe I should change @CAPS2 face looking with smiling and some confidence on it.' @CAPS8 that class, I started to put smile on @CAPS2 face and thought positively. I tried to be participate for the class and worked hard for making new friends in the new school. Therefore, the other student opened their mind as well and started to ask things about me. For example, it was like these questions; 'why did you come to @CAPS6 school?', 'what sports do you like most?', 'what game do you play?', and etc. From those aggressive questions, laughter can change @CAPS2 looking and make good relationships. How did I know? When I first entered to @CAPS2 classroom with concerning face on it, @CAPS5 just stared at me and looked like they didn't want to know about me. @CAPS8 putting laughter on @CAPS2 face, they started to feel comfortable than the first time. Changing me depressed face was @CAPS2 starting point in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome that how "the new guy" can be the leader of @CAPS6 class. I felt proud of myself and thought of happiness that I actually started to have laughter on @CAPS2 face since the teacher didn't look good without a laughter.

You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name @PERSON1. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON1 moved into the @CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when @PERSON1 first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about @PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say "like" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble.

                   @DATE2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a warm day, and @CAPS3 and I were on our way to my family reunion, in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. Our car was crammed, and with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two girls, @CAPS2 got really hot. @CAPS2 was about the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS2 felt like @CAPS2 had taken @NUM2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. @CAPS2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS3 was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, "@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last @DATE2. Those were good times.

                                    Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 For the @ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am "carefree " . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?

                                        Laughter: The @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, "yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly." @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, "I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me." I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!

The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is the shortest distance between two people. They express happiness, belonging and they let you forget your worries for a few seconds. Who does not like to laugh? I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS1 in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend.It all started in the morning of my first day in a @CAPS1 high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION1 before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envision for month, finally arrived. My host-mom said good-bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked in the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS4. During @CAPS4, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go.Her name was @PERSON1 and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION2 and the @LOCATION1. She also appeared quite interested to me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION3. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS1 in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to short the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION1. The end

 High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophmore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer. It wasn't like we made enemys with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully.  The @DATE1 going into my junior year i had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make-up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologise first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON1 anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might of moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good-bye to her. Lunch had past and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled there walked in @LOCATION1. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one sceond I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face bacame serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apoligise first, beacause I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsiblitie for what I had done to her.  One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON1. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e-mail. It would have been better to have aid it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e-mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presents around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways.  During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON1 came out of no where and sat next to me. She smiled and said "remember when you tripped in the @NUM1 grade?" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down face face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friends back. And the laughs can go on again.

Laughter is a important part of life. It is important in my life because it makes me happy. I am going to tell a true story about why laughter is so important to me and to my life. On days that I would be sad because of some stressful and unhappy things that were happening in my life at the moment. My friend @CAPS1 would come to my house to cheer me up. He would cheer me up by making me laugh, a lot. The main ways that he could make me laugh, when he would notice that I am sad were, tickling me randomly a lot, saying a funny joke or asking me a silly question and by making me play a video game or two, that I was very embarrassingly bad at. The first way he can get me to laugh is by tickling me. When he would come over we would just sit around and talk about random stuff that popped into our heads. He would notice me getting sad at some point and he would say that if I didn't cheer up he would tickle me so that I laughed to get cheered up. I wouldn't really cheer up so that he could make me laugh, to cheer me up. So, he would start to tickle me a lot. I am ticklish basically everywhere, so I would laugh hysterically and it was so much fun. After he would finally stop tickling me, I would still be laughing. If I were to get sad again, he would just keep on tickling me until he was sure that I was happy. I would get happy that day because of laughter.Another day that he was over just hanging out with me. I might not have been having that great of day. We would be watching a movie and eating pop corn or watching t.v., and he would notice that I wasn't really that happy. So, he would try and make me laugh to cheer me up. He would get me to laugh by saying some funny silly joke or asking me a weird random question. Little funny things like that will always make me laugh. Through out the day or while watching the movie. He would say something like it is so nice outside. When it really wasn't, he was just making me laugh. Or, something in the movie would happen and he would say how that would never be possible in real life. He would just get me to laugh to cheer me up. In addition to tickling me and saying something funny to make me laugh, he would also make me play a video game to get my mind off things. At his house one time he said that we should play some fun video games for something to do, because it would be rainy outside. At first he would show me how good he is at one of his favorite video games, likeAssassins @CAPS2. Then he would say that I should try to play it. I was not very good at it but it was fun. I am not used to the controls of an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 so I wouldn't know how to do some things, and he would make fun of me for it because it was actually supposed to be easy. When I couldn't do something I would laugh about it and give the controller to him because I couldn't do it and he could. That would make me laugh because I couldn't do something simple like run up a wall in the game, so, I would have to give it to him to do and that was funny to us. Being bad a video games is funny to me and it make me laugh. In turn that would make me happy which is important.In conclusion, by my friend @CAPS1 tickling me a lot, saying something weird and random, that is silly and funny or, by getting me to play video games that I was bad at and had to have him do it for me, would make me laugh. By him making me laugh, a lot, it made me very happy. Laughing is very important part of my life and this story. It is important because if I didn't laugh as much as he makes me, I would not be as happy. If I am not happy, that isn't a good thing. Because, being happy is a very important part of any life and relationship. Most of the ways I can get happy are by laughing. So, this story shows that laughing is very important part of my life. You could also say that is important in my relationship with @CAPS1. He make me laugh which makes me happy. That is very important to me.

Laughter is the shortest distance between two peopleFor the longest time I never thought that I could be happy. I felt as if every time I tried, someone was always there to say "@CAPS1 no, she's about to be happy. Better take everything away from her." That's @CAPS2 always happened; I was the one being dumped, cheated on, or losing a best friend. I would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand. I didn't think that wish would come true, but somehow it did. @PERSON2 was the type of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem also. That's @CAPS2 attracted me most to him. His sense of knowing when things weren't right and attempting to make them better. The thing I loved most about him was how he could make me happy when I felt so down. He didn't live close to me, he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better then anyone I've know for years. I guess I never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for that to be proven wrong.Freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and get a good boyfriend. My main focus that drove me through each class period was boys. It wasn't the best thing I could have focused on but hey, they got me through. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brown-blond hair sat in the front row. @PERSON2 was his name, and I suddenly became attached. I did @CAPS2 most girls do when they see a cute guy. Made a fool of myself. I was so sure that I was never going to get a chance with him until I got his number. The story goes on from there, we dated and dumped. For a while we didn't talk. But that's @CAPS2 made us bond even more. We later became best friends, and that is how I became happy.My boyfriend, was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was entranced on his ability to make me feel important. I assumed I wasn't important when I called @PERSON2, crying the night he cheated on me. Usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems, they don't know @CAPS2 to say. But when I talked to @PERSON2 he seemed as if he was going through the same thing. His perspective on the dilemma helped me get through it. I talked to him for the longest time that night, explaining how I felt. To my surprise, he actually cared and listened. After hours upon hours of talking, @PERSON2 and I finally realized that we have to be related in someway. Him and I have so much in common. We have both been through the same scenarios and we both help each other get past it. One time after a dance @PERSON2 called me saying, "I cried, when @PERSON1 left tonight." I helped him. Then later that month, he thought she was cheating on him. I helped him. I remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him I quit the dance team. People tell me not to get too attached to him, but I cant help it. We don't even have to be in the same room and he makes me smile. All the things we have been through make me laugh. He makes me laugh. He isn't the class clown or the comedian, but its just something in the way he can be himself and not get embarrassed that's @CAPS2 makes him so fun to be around. We @MONTH1 fight and not get along sometimes but I know he will always be there when I need him.Sometimes I sit and think back to the beginning of the year. When I was timid, quiet and unhappy. I think of how @PERSON2 is the most caring guy but you wouldn't notice it unless you got to know him. I think, "@CAPS2 if I never met @PERSON2" and I wonder if I would be the same person I am today. I now recognize that I have changed so much over these few months. Maybe its from @PERSON2, or maybe its just myself. But I'm pretty sure laughter has something to do with it. It brought me and @PERSON2 together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now. From being total strangers and now best friends. Maybe it is true; laughter is the shortest distance between two people.

Sometimes, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 I glanced around nervously as much mother drove up to the strange and unfamiliar building that was to be @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2. "@CAPS5 around! We can come back another time...or @CAPS2 not come back at all." @CAPS6 mother laughed and continued to search for a parking spot. I slumped down in @CAPS6 seat, discouraged and lonely. @DATE1 was the first day of @CAPS6 sophomore year in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, and I had to spend it at a new @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2; @ORGANIZATION1. Transferring to a new @ORGANIZATION2 would not @CAPS3 been so bad if I hadn't been forced to leave the @ORGANIZATION2 I loved, the @ORGANIZATION2 I had friends in, the @ORGANIZATION2 which met @CAPS6 selective needs and wants. I was dreading this day and only wished I could go home and sleep this vivid nightmare away.  @CAPS6 mom had to practically drag me from our minivan to the @ORGANIZATION2 doors, for both @CAPS6 body and mind were aching to run in the opposite direction. There was a massive crowd of students swarming around the room, which would later be known to me as "the commons." @CAPS6 mom introduced me to the woman in charge, @PERSON3, then waved goodbye and headed back to the car. I felt nauseous, and @CAPS6 heart was pounding as I glanced around at @CAPS6 new peers. I did not see even one familiar or friendly face. Not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when I was faced with new surroundings, such as this @ORGANIZATION2. The truth was, I didn't even want to make any friends. I @CAPS2 wanted to go back to @ORGANIZATION2;@CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION2.  As the day progressed, @CAPS6 mood only got worse. No one had even tried to be nice to me, and I wasn't really trying either. As the students were taking a field trip down to the @CAPS9 campus down the street, I ran into a girl who looked @CAPS2 as uncomfortable as I did. @CAPS14 had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. We started walking together, our steps in sync with each other, although no words were exchanged. We both @CAPS2 felt more comfortable standing next to each other, rather than standing alone. At the @CAPS9 campus, I decided to abandon @CAPS6 timid, protective shell, and I asked her where @CAPS14 was from. "@LOCATION1," @CAPS14 replied. "@CAPS6 family moved here last @DATE2, so I was home schooled until the end of the year," @CAPS14 informed me, her voice laced with nervousness. We continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building. I still had not learned her name though because I couldn't read the handwriting on her name tag, and I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. Fortunately @CAPS14 started talking about her name. "@CAPS6 parents named me @PERSON1 because @CAPS6 mom is @CAPS13, and I guess @CAPS14 really liked that name." @CAPS14 shrugged and rolled her eyes. @CAPS14 told me I could call her by her nickname, @PERSON2, because @CAPS14 didn't like people talking to her using her full name.  After our tour, all the groups of students headed back to the @ORGANIZATION2, for we were going to @CAPS3 a pizza party for lunch. As @PERSON2 and I sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the kids around us. "@CAPS15...This is going to be the worst year ever," I said gloomily. We stared pitifully at each other for a moment, sizing up the difficult times ahead of us. Then, simultaneously, we both cracked a smile. Next thing I knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with every breathe that managed to escape our lips.  Sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I pucker up @CAPS6 lips at the thought of how sour they are, and I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to @CAPS4. Although laughing did not automatically make @CAPS6 new @ORGANIZATION2 a fun and welcoming place, it made it @CAPS2 a little more bearable. Laughter truly is the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem is, and it can make two strangers into friends almost immediately.

 I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire @NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, "@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, "@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class.

 Laughter is a Element of @CAPS1  Laughter is a huge element of @CAPS1, without laughter @CAPS1 wouldn't be what it is today. Laughing is actually a element of why I am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now. I also believe "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" Someone once said. Laughter also breaks the ice with people either when their mad, sad, or just meeting the person. Also laughter can bring two people very close together. Here is a true story about how laughter is a element of @CAPS1. One day while I was with my best friend @PERSON1, we met up with her cousin @CAPS2 friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. This is no love story but he making me laugh broke the wall I had put up because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together the more closer i felt to him and comfortable I was around him. Eventually we started dating. Too this day we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of laughter, if it wasn't for the laughter @PERSON2 and I would not be as close as we are now. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I believe that because laughter gives you that feeling of security, like the sense that it is okay to be your self around strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun. Makes you feel like at this moment your bonding with this person. It doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when using laughter for the right reason, for example breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone that can bring them closer. Breaking the ice with laughter. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people making conversation and laughing could do that trick to make them feel not so shy and set back to talking. When I first meet people I am very shy until someone makes me laugh then I am very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone. But laughter could always push you away from someone. When I was upset about me and my ex fiance breaking up for the first time after year and a half no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @PERSON1 brought me out to the state fair, being on the rides and laughing with her, brought her and I closer also I was not mad anymore. She broke that anger and hurt inside of me just by laughing. A huge element of @CAPS1 is laughter, there is no doubt about that. Depending on the persons perspective laughing @MONTH1 not be a element of @CAPS1 to them but to me it is. With out the feeling of security when laughing with @PERSON2 we wouldn't be as close as we are now. With out laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we are together. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Someone once said. @CAPS1 would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter.

 My friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in the @TIME1. It was his friends from high school there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised @ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that matter. Instead the friends replied and told him how they was doing and then told @ORGANIZATION2 they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself "why the heck are you telling me about this", and then said cool. what do you need from me? The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ORGANIZATION2 finally said he would help and plan the trip out. Then asked the friend were he would want to go for this trip, The friend replied I don't know i wanna see a professional baseball game and were ever @ORGANIZATION1 land is i would love to go there. A week and a half went by later @ORGANIZATION2 called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them. its a ten day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION1 then driving down to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION2, then go to six flags another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION1. The friends replied what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us. @ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them :you guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps. Thinking hard about the situation @ORGANIZATION2 finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work.For example he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at.  The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At lest for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan they hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exiting and brought @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days.The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup. but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet. Last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly.They just had one more event. the giants baseball game, then stay with there old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION2. making sure they would have a place to stay for sure @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replayed with a"no i haven't talked to him yet. i will call him later."this made @ORGANIZATION2 a little uneasy, so he told his friend no call him now.the friend did.There other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self I knew this trip was to good to be true. On the @TIME1 of the baseball game things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION2 is so random and bad. Mean while @ORGANIZATION2 for got to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION2 had to go bad. But his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going. which @ORGANIZATION2 listened and kept going. Then traffic came to a stand still. @ORGANIZATION2 was going to go in his pants!so he pulled off and drove down the side of the high way surprised he didn't get pulled over he miraculously ended up at giants stadium then he saw a portable potty he pulled over and raced to it,it was locked. @ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. he takes off as fast as he could for it. And yes it was open finally @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self ecstatically! he stepped inside but then looking at the urinal he realizes he didn't get there fast enough and embarrassingly he went in his pants.

 Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1 opinion laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the coarse of the @DATE1 through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter.  One of @DATE1 experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1 family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate.  @DATE1 favorite exchange students was @PERSON1, a student from @LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country they speak @CAPS2 and @LOCATION2 and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE1 happiest memories.  @PERSON1 could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom.  Once @PERSON1, @DATE1 best friend @PERSON2, and I spent an entire day laying in the grass at a park putting on ridiculous skits for each other, and telling comical stories, laughing until our bellies hurt. Between out bursts of laughter @PERSON1 would exclaim "@CAPS3 you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!" @CAPS4 she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing.  When I went to visit @PERSON1 in @LOCATION3 we had many similar situations of outrageous, uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS5, @DATE1 sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. We toured through the serious quiet building unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making funny faces and dancing around, unable to contain our joy.  I don't know @PERSON1 @CAPS4 well @CAPS4 @DATE1 friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection to her then most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at every and anything. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE1, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic.

What's a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Laughter?  Would me and @PERSON1 be best friends @CAPS2 ever laughing? That would be a negative. I honestly think laughter is the biggest part of @CAPS1. What kind of @CAPS1 is two friends who never laugh? If there are any people in the world that don't laugh, I bet they don't have any friends, well at least true friends. I feel sorry for these people. I can't even imagine life @CAPS2 laughter. All of my friends and I laugh all the time. Especially with me and @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 and I are around each other, @CAPS5's usually non stop laughter. @PERSON1 and I laugh about almost everything. We have so many inside jokes its not even funny (well to me and her @CAPS5 is), such as "an upstairs @CAPS3 @CAPS4!" or "john, john, john, john". See there things people wouldn't think where funny, but whenever one of us blurts one of our stupid inside jokes out, we start laughing until we ball our eyes out. If I imagine me and @PERSON1 never laughing, then that would be the worst @CAPS1. I hate to even think about us never laughing. @CAPS5 sounds horrible. If me and @PERSON1 never laughed, then we most likely would not be friends. I'm so glad I have so much laughter in my life. I don't know what I would do @CAPS2 @CAPS5.

@ORGANIZATION1 you think of a relationship, what do you think of? Do you think laughter is a big element in a relationship? Laughter meaning laughing sounds indicating merriment or derision. Many people have been in a relationship before from excellent to bad they knew @ORGANIZATION1 laughing with each other they enjoyed the enjoyment from one another. First of all @ORGANIZATION1 a couple is laughing they enjoy being together therefore it makes them want to spend more time with one another. Laughing by it's self let's the couple have a better beyond with each other. The couple would obtained a better connection to. Thus they would be able to understand each other. for example @ORGANIZATION1 a couple is just out having a excellent time they would want to keep sharing the wonderful beyond with each other. Another reason laughter is a element of a relationship it will end up letting the couple have a stronger relationship because thy would have a marvelous connection with each other therefore they would be able to understand each other. Therefore things between them would succeed in a stronger and better relationship. Next time you are in a relationship think about how laughter,is a element and how enjoyment, connection, more time with each other and stronger relationship all some how benefits just from laughter. So the next time you are laughing with your boyfriend or girlfriend think about what you guys are benefiting from just laughing with one another.

 It has been said that "Laughter is the spark of the soul." I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it truly does ignite a spark. And once that spark has been ignited watch out, it will burn like a wild fire. As the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the the body. First its that uncontrollably smile that brings an ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that marvelously flutters through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least the tears of joy come streaming from your eyes. Had these feelings before? That'@CAPS5 the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn.  Laughter is an extraordinary thing--it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter I wasn't the one laughing...About three weeks ago while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS1, and I went to visit my grandparents and to see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending sometime at their house it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS2. My grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then I mentioned that @CAPS1 and I could go do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpas @LOCATION1, everything seemed fine; just another ordinary day. After we had arrived at the gymnastics center we headed inside and waited for @PERSON1 to finish. However, as we were walking out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward--when all of the sudden I heard a loud crunch! My heart dropped as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building.  Now before I go on I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very good driver. But hey, that first crash happens to all of us, right? Well back to my story, as I was driving back to my grandparents house it took everything I had not to cry. After we arrived back at their house @CAPS1 and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5. pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the the building was gone. The dent didn't look so bad once the paint was gone and the truck was back to white. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour I finally got up the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes and we went out to look at the damage. As I started crying because I felt so bad, my grandpa just started laughing and reminding me that it was just a truck and it can be fixed.The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime. So no matter if you're laughing about something that makes you happy or a situation that maybe isn't so good, let the fire burn.

 School had just gotten out. It was the @DATE2 before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the @DATE1 few weeks. We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS2 was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes..

  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said "hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods" "sure why not" we all said "we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say "there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous "alright" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes "sorry" we both said" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly" i said with animosity. "@CAPS5 what is it" @PERSON3 said "don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean" said @PERSON1 " "oh daaanngg" @PERSON2 said "i think were gonna die if we got back over there" @CAPS1 complained. "@CAPS7 gonna be just fine" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. "@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there"I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said "lets go see what is in that tree" "im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. "@CAPS13 up" he said "that wasn't me it was @PERSON1" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life.

  One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat.  The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice.   About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together.

 Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called "linemen hands" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of "@CAPS2-field", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 "The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said "I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance" and then @PERSON1 responded "@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said "@CAPS4 are you laughing" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END

 Bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hill tops as the waking sun began to rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air arose the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their mellifluous tone of song. Gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator @MONTH1 agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one is to catch a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON1 stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON1's teary eyes and wet face began to dry. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, a long lost memory interrupted @PERSON1's thought for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice.  "@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone," @CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE1, and six-year-old @PERSON1 came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky stair case and skipped to his parent's room. "@CAPS2 @CAPS3?" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass door knob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the mid-wife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. "@CAPS4 hello to your new baby sister,"said @PERSON1's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON1 began to place the tip of his @CAPS7 light-up sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. "@CAPS5 was born less that an hour ago," said his father. @PERSON1 then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch-by-inch, he slowly began to peal back the top blanket; but, before @PERSON1 could even finish this task, the new-born baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON1's reaction, but was careful no to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide-eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON1's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her moth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in a hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 began to relax and smiled at this mother. "@CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?" @CAPS5 asked. His father chimed in, I would think so!" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the mid-wife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father.  @PERSON1 could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS5 could of won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS5 didn't. Now @CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @CAPS7 then, @PERSON1 suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; however, the memories made and laughter shared still continues to engulf @PERSON1 with his mother's love.   In my mind, @PERSON1 is classified as a superior individual. As I am his only full sister, he never fails to educate me of his past memories with our mother. I love her and miss her, but know I will see her again someday; and when I do, we will be bound together with joy and laughter.

After that we got to talking i started making him laugh and eventaully he said "you make me laugh i like that i will buy some". I think that the laughter pklayed a key roll in him buying the cookie dough.

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3.It all started with @DATE1. We were opening our presents when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands where four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and told them that they are the best @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE2. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM1 a.m because our plane was scheduled to depart at @TIME1. Before we left our house I asked my @CAPS1 if I could bring my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My @CAPS1 ended up taking her while my @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane .My other sister did not like that my @CAPS1 was not on the plane with us yet. So my @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my @CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it's speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched in to the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said that it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that once we got to @ORGANIZATION1 we would go on all the rides that we want. Three hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. Once we got off the plane we went to pick up our bags from the baggage claim. My @CAPS2 went to see when the next @CAPS11 @CAPS12 was scheduled to arrive. As he came back the @CAPS12 was just coming down the road. The @CAPS12 was blue with @CAPS11 characters. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @CAPS15 that we were staying in was called The @CAPS14 @CAPS15. It had a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once we were settled in we went in to @LOCATION1. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the @CAPS11 characters autographs and pictures. My favorite one was @CAPS17 because he reminds me of myself. We got to stay in the park for about three hours when we started getting hungry so we left and went back to the @CAPS15. After dinner we went down to the pool to go swimming. It seemed to be funner than @ORGANIZATION1 because in the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming down by the pool than actually in @LOCATION1. That is the best time that I had ever had in my life and I owe it all to my parents. I love them very much. Thank you.

 My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared many laughs, memories, and tears, yet to this day we're still closer than ever. One of the key reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh. We joke around and we make any boring time into a good one. This is the story of how our relationship came to be and some of the reasons why we are still best friends. It started in third grade. I was walking alone on the playground when she asked me to play with her, having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played for the whole recess, and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together. The first time she invited me to her house, I was kind of nervous. I was afraid it was going to be awkward, or that we wouldn't have a good time. When we got to her house after school, we went to her room, played video games for a little bit, and then we had a snack. We brought our crackers to her room, sat on the ground, and started to eat. Out of no where we just looked at each other, and we started laughing like crazy. They weren't little giggles either, we laughed so hard it brought tears to our eyes. From that day forward we hung out as often as we could. A couple of years went by, we hung out more often, and declared ourselves best friends. When fifth grade came around, we were glued to the hip. Her dad was our teacher, so he already knew how close we both were. We never really got to sit next to each other, but we still managed to talk a lot. One day at recess we were joking around and she said your butt is so big, you're going to break a chair. These days it doesn't seem that funny, but in fifth grade it was hilarious. When we got inside we played this math game, I got the question wrong so I plopped down in my chair, sure enough, it broke. Other kids that heard what she said laughed, but no one really quite laughed as much as we both did.  Fifth grade was also when boys started coming into the picture. During @DATE1 break she really liked this one guy, and when he said he didn't like her, she was completely broken. That night she came over to talk with me about it, but we never ended up talking about it at all. Instead, we watched funny movies and I would do things on purpose to make her laugh. Even though we were already really close, that night made us grow even closer. At the end of fifth grade we had a little graduation ceremony. Towards the end they put on a slide show of everyone in the fifth grade class. One of the pictures was of @PERSON1 and I with mud masks on, we were both embarrassed, but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night, and we wondered how the picture got on the slide show. After the ceremony @PERSON1 and I threw a party. We shared many laughs and still that made us grow even closer, even though we had made new friends that night, our bond was unbreakable. Middle school was a whole new experience. New friends, different classes, and more drama. I hate to say it, but we grew apart those three years. We had none of the same classes and we both met new people, but every time I went over to her house, or every time we hung out, we laughed till we were crying, and gasping for air. A lot of things happened, our different friends fought, some of them moved, but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin. Towards the end of our middle school lives, we grew closer again, and things were pretty much back to normal.  Today @PERSON1 and I are as close as we were in fifth grade if not closer. When we are together not only do we make ourselves laugh, but we make other people laugh as well. We are together almost every weekend, and we @MONTH1 not do much, but we always end up laughing like crazy. Doing cheer, we also spend even more time together. Other things in our relationship are important too, like trust, loyalty, and kindness, but laughter is what has kept us together through everything we have been through. Laughter is also the reason we have become friends in the first place and I am happy to call her my best friend. Without her, my life would be very boring, and I hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives. Laughing keeps people together and makes relationships grow stronger. This was an example of how it helped me and my best friend become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us.

Don't speak, laugh. I love @CAPS11 little brother. We're @NUM1 years apart in age @CAPS7 from the way we act, @CAPS3'd think we were twins. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, @CAPS7 this one was one @CAPS4 could not back down from. I beat him at @CAPS1 tennis. @CAPS14 was a warm afternoon, and me and @CAPS11 brother had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing @CAPS1.  "@CAPS3 cheated." @CAPS4 said firmly. "@CAPS5 I didn't!" I snapped back. I could tell that @CAPS4 was getting really upset about this, @CAPS7 I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. "@CAPS6 yes @CAPS3 did. @CAPS3 always do! @CAPS14's not fair." "@CAPS7 I didn't this time." @CAPS4 was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, @CAPS7 I won fair and square. "@CAPS3're just mad because @CAPS3 lost. Get over yourself and take @CAPS14 like a man." That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. "@CAPS6! What did @CAPS3 do to your brother?" @CAPS11 mom yelled. "@CAPS4 beat him at a game and now @CAPS4's mad." I knew @CAPS4 would do that. @CAPS17 and report me to @CAPS11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. "@CAPS13 @CAPS14's just a game. @CAPS3 can't win every time." "@CAPS14's just not fair!" @CAPS4 said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. @CAPS14 makes me feel superior. @CAPS7 of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to @CAPS17 and apologize. "@CAPS13?" I knocked on his door. "I'm sorry for making @CAPS3 cry. @CAPS14's just a game though. @CAPS3 win some and @CAPS3 lose some. Don't be mad." I gave the most heart-felt apology I could think of at the moment. "@CAPS17 away. I don't want to talk to @CAPS3." @CAPS17 away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and @CAPS4 tells me to @CAPS17 away? Oh @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of @CAPS11 mouth was, "@CAPS19.". And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that @CAPS4 was this upset about @CAPS14. @CAPS14 was probably one of the longest periods of times @CAPS4 didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that @CAPS4 wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, @CAPS4 was downstairs playing the @CAPS1 again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of @CAPS11 room and started to walking down the stairs. @CAPS4 could hear me coming, so @CAPS4 turned down the volume of the @CAPS21.  "@CAPS13 listen. Are @CAPS3 really not going to talk to me over a game I-" @CAPS23! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. "@CAPS24!" @CAPS4 was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh.

                             laughter      why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh?Is laughter a healthy thing you should have in your health chart?This are some questions you might    ask yourself.But when you do have you thought of yourself, and maby have you thought of how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or maby the family room anywere as long as you hear laughter coming out of your mouth.It doesn't matter an what you laugh about, it can be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or a funny commercial. it doesnt matter as long as you laugh.in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life.if you dont laugh then you must be a very seriouse person or you might even think that the world is a very boring place to be in.some how i cant really imagine a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people that dont really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just doesnt have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood.I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother an i to quiet sown whaen we would talk in the family table during dinner one day. One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments. So when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said ok and we tried it .It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table. It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting.Like i told you in the first paragraph theres many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comody show i very good idea would be @PERSON1 that show always mekes me crack up sometimes my mom thinks im crazy. Or ever family @CAPS1 thats such a great show to watch wene your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes theres the knock knock shows and then theres the guess what i am jokes . but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tikling that always works theres no way you cant ever make someone laugh. Eather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a @CAPS2 see who laughs first contest.It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while. I heard tha t if you laugh alot suposlly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems.

During the @DATE1 I decided to join @ORGANIZATION2, I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the @LOCATION1. Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work. Without patience, great teachers, and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE1 I had some great experiences and some of them, not so great. This was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet funny moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION1. This was also @ORGANIZATION1's first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower. Turns out I was in to much of a hurry. My boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance, I tried using the shovel to catch my self but it was too late. I was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe, I had fallen in it. @ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes, but was only about six seconds, then we busted out in laughter. After our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher @PERSON1.  When @PERSON1 saw my once blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh at me. He got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile. After all the joking, laughing, and pictures were finished @PERSON1 gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the shower. This is an experience I will never forget. If I didn't have friends around me I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some pretty fun memories out of that @DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter it might of been a little negative, I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an important element to have in a positive healthy lifestyle.

 Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS2 I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON2. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like "@CAPS1 here!" or "@CAPS2 way!". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS2 game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS2 race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me.

 I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like "how in the world is that a picture of a sock!" or "That's not fair, you know the actual definition!" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that "life is short." I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter.

 My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair that they put in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said "yeah you can go" i was really exited cause that would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying "what if we were on a ride and we fell out," but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM4 in the @TIME1.  @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was on a @DATE1, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @PERSON1 his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME3. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the @CAPS9 it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the @CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM7 so they weren't opened so we had to wait @NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. @PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what @PERSON1 and I were talking about "that how funny would it be if we fell out." so i held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON1 and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying "if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant" I laughed with then then said "I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME2 we had to leave so we left waited for the @CAPS9. As we were waiting for the @CAPS9 two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures and went home.

Laughter: A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows @MONTH1 be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"; instances of laughter are @CAPS1 anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a @CAPS1 action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a @CAPS1 action that "personifies" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the @CAPS1 language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people.

 The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, "@CAPS5!" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. "@CAPS9 like a nice hike," I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.

 My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.
<START>

 Folded In @DATE1 it was right around @DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM1 lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.

 Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your heath, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON1 had left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION1, or what we call @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION1 had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION1 did or received school wise. She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON1's time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON2. I'm a person who is excepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much to hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON1, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION2 members very happy.  @PERSON2 glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION2, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON2 as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON2 to remember our names. @PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home. On my way out @PERSON2 stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON2, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION2 accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON2, and made for a life long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @PERSON2 would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON2's first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting.
<START>

@PERSON1 In a mother and daughter relationship @CAPS2 need laughter. It's so important to have that connection with someone that is so important and close to @CAPS2. Just in general @CAPS2 need laughter, it shows how @CAPS2 express yourself and it brings out your character.  This one laughing experience, it was the @DATE1 of my eighth grade year, so I was @NUM1 or @NUM2. My family and family friends went on a camping trip. So the day before we were suppose to leave, my mother, brother and myself went up to set up camp. We when got to the campground, we immediately started putting everything together and organizing. It was a lot of fun but it was getting dark fast so we moved faster until it was completely finished. On our way out we noticed that we forgot something in the truck so my mom stopped the truck and looked at me and asked, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 want to drive right now?". Of course I didn't think twice. I jumped out of the truck and ran to other side. All sorts of excitement was going through my body. When I got to the other side I hopped right onto the driver seat, with the biggest smile on my face. My mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck. Examples; seat belt, steering wheel, mirrors and adjusting the seat. The family vehicle was a stick shift so I was all sorts of nervous. I had no idea on how to shift and when to exactly. I used to watch my mom and step dad when they shifted and when, I would make humming noises but that obviously didn't help me any. The first thing I had to @CAPS1 was to start the truck because mom turned it off before she got out. I had to put the clutch in all the way and make sure it was in neutral. So I started that thing up, thinking to myself on how cool I probably look right now, the average @NUM1 year old ego. The going part was the worst! I probably killed the truck about @NUM4 times before the tires actually went at a constant speed that they should be going at. My mom said, "The fifteenth time is a charm". She probably thought she was being funny but trust me it was not a funny moment. I gave a nervous laugh right back at her, which probably didn't make me feel any better. So I started the truck once again and go to moving. I wasn't going very fast, more like the speed of a turtle but that was alright with me because I had no idea what was going on. The truck was going too slow to go anywhere, so I pushed in the gas a little bit harder. Coming around the bin, going about roughly @NUM4 miles per hour, still at a slow pace as before. The camp ground was only about @NUM6 to @NUM7 miles away. Which seemed like it was taking forever!  We were coming up to the campground. I could tell because we had a sign that said @PERSON1 with a arrow pointing left. So I took that left and saw all of our stuff. There was a river on the back side of where of our camp was and trees were circling all around us. So it was an enclosed area, except for one side. Where @CAPS2 could see to the other side of the river and there were other people camping on the other side. Which was kind of nice because they had kids my age. My mom pointed and told me to go over by the tent and park. For an inexperience driver I got anxious and put my foot onto the gas instead of the break so that @NUM4 m.p.h went up to about @NUM9 in the matter of seconds. We were going so fast that I couldn't really react to what was going on. All I could hear was my brother in the back seat yelling like when a little girl finds a spider. My mom grabbed onto the steering wheel as fast as she could because we were heading right towards the river and was about to make a quick visit to the people across the way. Instead of going that direction we went into a pick-nick table and pushed that right into another one and landed right onto a third table. We were at least @NUM10 feet off the ground onto the pile of broken tables. I had a adrenaline rush and I'm pretty sure the passengers did too.  We all got out of the truck and literally stopped and starred at the situation for a good @NUM11 minutes before we started busting up laughing. We all looked over across the river and saw their entire family just starring and laughing at us. My mom looked at them for a few seconds and then looked at us and said, "@CAPS2 all can come over later for a fire!""
<START>

 The night was a cool, @DATE1 night, not too cold but definetly not the muggy temperatures @DATE2 brought you. This was the type of @NUM1 degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt and still be comfortable. The air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friends front door. Overhead I knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house I knew both of my bestfriends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces.  All of that made my heart give occasional, hard, thumps on my chest from the nervousness. Yet, I pretended that everything was okay. "For all I know", I told myself, "it might as well be, and I'm overreacting." I knocked on the white-painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side-paneling, waiting for an answer. My friend @LOCATION1 answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend @PERSON1 laughing. I knew that I had missed out on something, the laughter explained that to me as I stepped inside. There was a hollow feeling in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed out on. I hated not knowing. A mix of emotions jumped around inside my body, causing my head to be a jumbled mess that I couldn't make sense of.  I gently pushed open @LOCATION1's bedroom door with my fingertips. Like always, the turquoise walls and the sound of radio station music jumped out to greet me. @PERSON1 was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me, she stopped and stared. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was mad, fine. I didn't do anything wrong and I would maintain my innocence. The moment was stretching and stretching to the point I thought it might break, then @CAPS1 hugged me, completely catching me off gaurd, but filling me with a sense of right, because I'd known I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then @PERSON1 explained the gut feeling I had when I was walking home from school that day. I was being accused of not putting in any work into a reading project. The accusation appalled me and deflated my pride. Instead, a mild anger boiled up and I simply walked out the door and into the cool night. I heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but I kept walking. I told myself this was out of anger, but @DATE3 I know it was for the sake of making a scene.  The footsteps I listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw @PERSON1 running at me. Against my will, I let out a high-pitched scream and started running, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. @PERSON1 caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of her grip, out of sheer stubborness, I planted my butt on the curb and refused to budge. I realized I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, that I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last ribbons of laughter still danced around in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay.

  I was in @NUM1 grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well @NUM2 days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole @DATE1, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the @DATE2 class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my @NUM3 top favorite memories and moments of any school year. True Story.
<START>

My story about laughter is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors. I love to play sports always have, always will. Iv been playing football for about @NUM1 years now and iv never been hurt, except one pracitce. It was in @NUM2 grade. My football team always does one hitting drill once a week. The drill is called truck and trailer. Its where you have @NUM3 people. Two people on offence and two peole on defense. The two people on offence are trying to score and the two people on defence are trying to stop them. Of course I get stuck with running the ball and not to mention the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. This kid couldn't do anything on the football field other then keep the bench warm. The two biggest and best hitters were on defence trying to kill me. I knew that this was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so i do. My coach (my dad) hikes the ball and I take off. Soon enough they catch up with me and take me off my feet. One went high and the other went low. I hit the ground and stayed down. I hear my teammates start screaming. I thought it was because i got ''cracked". I thought wrong. I sit up and my knee kinda hurts. I look at it and it looks like rubber. My leg was pointing the opposite way that it's supposed to go. Iv only seen a brake like that on tv and youtube. My dad doesnt hesitate too call @NUM4. The ambulance came to the field @NUM5 minutes later. They came down to the field and put my on a strecher. My team wasnt the only team that used that field. About @NUM5 other teams practiced at the same time. All eyes were on me. And on my leg. The other teams didnt know what happened except that they had a big ice back on my private area. All my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was embarrasing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg they still woud make fun of me. I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasnt fun for me and especially not funny. But all my friends thought it was hilasious.
<START>

 Being on a team doesn't always mean that everyone is the best of friends; most of the time the case is that you really don't get along with the people on your team. That was the case for the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION4) @CAPS3 that I'm a member of. Everything changed after our trip to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 for @ORGANIZATION2. It was late, twelve members of the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS3 were shuffling into the @LOCATION2 to check-in. Everyone was in their group of friends talking and anxiously waiting to leave @ORGANIZATION4 for our eight day trip. Each group of people didn't always get along with the people in the other groups (even though we were a team) other people got along with everyone they just had their own close friends that they stuck with. Emotions were at a wide variety that night between the tension of conflict between people, nervousness, and excitement. When our plane had finally landed in @LOCATION1 everyone was completely drained of energy, but once again everyone split up into their own groups and we moved through the @LOCATION1. @CAPS5 we walked through the @LOCATION2 to the luggage claim I began to wonder, " @CAPS4 is it that we are all together and a team, but we separate ourselves to different groups amongst our team and everyone notices, but it doesn't change?" @CAPS5 I pondered the thought we headed out to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day. After the long day of flying and touring places around downtown @LOCATION1 we finally were at the hotel checking in. @CAPS5 we checked in everyone separated vastly with their groups of friends who they rooming with to check-in to their rooms. Later that evening a few us that were really close friends went outside to hang out by the campfires they had at the hotel we were staying at. @CAPS5 we sat there talking and laughing, having a great time there was a moment when we just sitting there quietly, and I proceeded to ask them about what I been thinking about back at the @LOCATION2. The response I got back from everyone was blank stares and a change of subject. The next morning came early, we went off to breakfast then left for the day to go do some touring. The first place we went to out of three place we were to be touring that day was the @ORGANIZATION1. At the @ORGANIZATION1 our @CAPS3 faced our first team building/bonding activity. The task we were to accomplish with one another was difficult at first for everyone, but we all slowly began having a fun time laughing and working to accomplish what we needed. After we had finished the activity everyone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal group. Later that same day we had a second team building/bonding activity. After we finished that activity there was a sense of less tension between everyone, even less than from after the morning activity. The following day we had two more team building/bonding activities. Each time we had an activity everyone began to connect more and more and each time came more laughter. We also began to spend more @CAPS5 a whole @CAPS3 and got have an even better time of fun and laughter filled adventures. By the time we were all heading to the @LOCATION2 to fly back to @LOCATION3 everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict. @CAPS5 the plane took off the realization of everything had came to me of @CAPS4 before there was so much conflict and everyone being split up into separate groups. I realized that we had always been on a "business like" relationship with one another we never gave the chance to laugh, have a good time, and connect and allow us to get to know each other. Once we took the time to allow all of those things we learned who everyone was and made friendships.
<START>

 They say that "laughter is the shortest distance between two people" and I agree completely. You can't be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them. It makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be more difficult to have.  I have a bestfriend and her names @CAPS1. We were bestfriends ever since the day we found out we had the same birthday. But to us, that meant we were twin sisters.
<START>

Laughing @CAPS1 you remember when you would laugh so hard you couldn't breathe? Or when you started crying because you were laughing? When ever I start laughing I am always with my best friend, @PERSON1. We sometimes even when things aren't funny. We giggle at everything. Memories, the future, or even just looking at each other we laugh. You name it, we've laughed at it.  @PERSON1 and I have almost always laughed together. From when we first met in seventh grade, and now when I am a freshman, we still don't ever stop. She was in my sixth period class and we sat by each other. After the first couple of minutes we talked we both knew something good was going to come from this. So of course, from that moment on we had to be best friends. I couldn't ask for a friend better then her. She is the best.  All of our free time was spent with one another. Even some time when we were busy we were still together. @PERSON1 and I were together basically every day and every night. We would camp out in my backyard, or ride bikes around the town. I would go swimming with her family. She would go to @LOCATION1 with ours. Both of both of our families would go and @CAPS1 things together. We did all sorts of things together. No matter what we always laughed.  Growing up can be pretty tough sometimes for anybody. @PERSON1 and I were no exception to this. After a bad day, you would know you could find us on the phone talking to each other. We could talk for hours and hours about the littlest things. I think we have talked for three hours before just about what we were going to wear the next day. Never hanging up until one of us getting told to get off the phone. I think I can speak for the both of us when I say, we hung up with a completely different outlook on life. Even on the worst of our days, we were still laughing. I don't think I would ever be able to grow up with out her. @PERSON1 is such a big part of my life. I would be nothing without her.  @PERSON1 and I @CAPS1 not go to the same school anymore, but that still doesn't prevent us from laughing. If you have ever had a friend as close to you as @PERSON1 is to me, you know how great it feels to be close to somebody. Just think about the feeling of never ending laughter. I strongly believe with all of my being, it is one of the best feelings in the world. @PERSON1 and I never stop, why should I let anybody else. With out laughter, we wouldn't be as close as we are today. With out laughter the world wouldn't be how it is today. So find a friend and start laughing. You'll see how great it is to laugh with someone. I guarantee it.

 Isnt it funny how just a laugh can change a senery, a mood like someones face expression, and make a person laugh out of nowhere just because it is outrageous, or the laugh they hear sounded funny. I personaly have been through all of these stages of what I like to call, the contagious circle of laughs. In the past I have been cheered up by laughing, and hearing others laugh. At times even I have cheered others by makeing them laugh, or laughing at @CAPS3 own humourless jokes. It feel good to laugh, and at the end of @CAPS3 long lasting giggles I feel refreshed from useing all that energy just to make a noise. @CAPS3 friends pick me out to be the clown in our group. They all think im this hilarious joke popper ( I pop out all these funny jokes ) I personaly dont think im that funny, but for some reason just by makeing them laugh I laugh too. There is this one joke I made up all by myself to cheer up @CAPS3 friend @LOCATION2. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. It is about walking through the store, and seeing the different nationalitys of mothers with there baby's. How each mother treats there baby's differently. At the end I tell how the african american mother yells at her baby to shut up. I use a cuss word but thats inappropriate for this writeing piece. You get the idea. Anyway @CAPS3 friends still to this day ask me to tell them that joke, and they always laugh just as loud as the first time I told them. There is always one person in your life that your totaly obbsesed about there laugh, only because you love the way it sounds. I personaly fell in love with @CAPS3 boyfreinds laugh, and that was why he looked so darn cute to me. The very first time we met he was picking on his cousin @CAPS1 in a park up in @LOCATION1. I was with @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 in the trailer park where her dad lived at the time. Malikye ( @CAPS3 boyfriend ) had this laugh that made me want to scream "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!", it was so funny. I wanted to run over to him and tickle him to death so he couldnt ever stop laughing. Most of the people that know him hate his laugh, and think it is obnoxious. He even hates his own laugh. I dont know why but I was addicted to it. It is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them. A laugh not only shows you sound, but shows you personality, and charecter. Laughing is a big importance in life. It shows so much about a person, and helps so many people. I love laughing. People should be full of laughter, because without it the world would be a dull and unhappy place. I dont know anyone who would want that. Evil @CAPS5 maybe, but he even has his evil laugh that shows his charecter....

 My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when hes has a beer or when hes with friends. Last @DATE1 we where at my grandparent's house for a family barbecue when we got a call from mt @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1 she told us that my @CAPS1 was in my great aunts will, a few days earlier we had gotten a call saying that great aunt @PERSON2 had died. My grandpa thought he was going to be in the will but he wasn't. Two weeks latter my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and me went to @LOCATION2 for my great aunts funeral. When we got to @LOCATION2 we drove to the upper peninsula. It turns out that we where going to a island on lake @LOCATION3 called @LOCATION1 island. Then when we got to my @CAPS3 cousin @PERSON1's house she toke us through the will. My @CAPS1 got @NUM1 acres, @NUM2 acres of forest, @NUM3 acres meadow, and @NUM3 acres with a two bedroom house, barn, and smoke shed.

 When I had turned fifteen I was so anxious to get my permit. I didn't study for it, but I thought to myself how hard could this really be? The first time I went to take the test I went with my best friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had already taken the test once and failed so she was trying again. We got to the @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM1 a.m sharp. I was anxiously sitting there waiting to take my test and that's when they called my number. The women at the @ORGANIZATION1 was very nice to me she said "all I need is your birth certificate, your social security, and proof of enrollment" I handed the envelope to her that I had containing all of these. She okay'd me to go and take my test I sat at computer number six. I was not nervous at all I thought how could I not pass this.When the test began there was so many questions of things I didn't know like motorcycles,left turns, and things about animals that were on the road. I finished the test with @PERCENT1 I only needed to get @PERCENT2 to pass, I was bummed out that I had failed. @PERSON1 however had passed her test I was happy for her and I congratulated her but I was still in a way jealous of her. My @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 told me "it's okay you will get it for sure next time!" @CAPS1 they were wrong. I was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get there permit. I had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before I did. It seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up. I was extremely discouraged and sad about this because in a way I felt like a failure but I was determined to get my permit no matter how many times it took me.  I went back @DATE1 after taking my permit test for the first time to take my test again I failed, I had failed for the second time. I went back again five more times I failed my permit test five times. My @CAPS2 and I were driving back one morning after I had failed I was very sad because I was going to have to wait a whole month again before I could take it. That is when my @CAPS2 just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me. I was very confused at why she would act this way. She told me "sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn it is okay to not always get things right the first time life is about sticking to things and having fun if you can't laugh at mistakes that are made then what is the fun in that?" I realized she was completely right and that's when I stopped beating myself up over not getting my permit. I laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home. I didn't mind that I didn't pass because I knew I was going to get it if I just relaxed and studied.  The next month I went back to take the test again. I went through all the steps in the @ORGANIZATION1 again I waited for them to call my number, I gave the women my information, and I sat down at the computer. I got @PERCENT3 this time! I was so stoked and so happy that I had passed I was mostly just surprised my @CAPS2's advice had worked.  @DATE1 that day I was driving home from the store with my @CAPS2. I was not the best driver I think because it was only my first day, and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I had mistaken the gas for the break and I ran into the garage door. Surprisingly she had started laughing and this made me laugh. Instead of yelling at me and reaming me for this mistake we were able to laugh about it and I think that is what made a world of difference, because if she would have yelled at me I would have been discouraged to try driving again. Now I have had my permit for four months not only am I a better driver but I have learned to relax a little bit more I have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many great simple things in the world for granite. I also think that it made me closer to my @CAPS2 in a way so I guess it is true what they say "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."

  About @NUM1 years ago, my best friend @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I were having a sleep over at her house. We were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball. We had been jumping, standing, flipping, @CAPS6 everything you could think of but trying to do that with out falling off of it! @LOCATION1 went to go do this flip on to the ball @CAPS6 she said " @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watch this cool thing I just did!" @CAPS3 she try's to do the same thing she did, but she messes up, @CAPS6 the giant ball went flying out from under her! We started laughing @CAPS3 hard! It was @CAPS3 funny that she almost peed her pants! But then her older sister came in, @CAPS6 that's when it all started... @PERSON1, (@LOCATION1's older sister) was always much bigger than us @CAPS3 we did @CAPS8 she said no matter @CAPS8. As soon as she walked in we stopped @CAPS8 we were doing! She said that she wanted to play a game with us, @CAPS3 we decided to play too. @PERSON1 told us to get on the bed @CAPS6 go under the blankets. @CAPS3 we did @CAPS6 right when we did the light shut off! @CAPS6 the door slammed shut! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not @CAPS3 we didn't say a word.  The next thing you know, the door barley creeks open @CAPS6 you can see a little bit of light through the crack. She was back, @CAPS6 with supplies! It was silent for about @NUM2 minutes, then @LOCATION1 starts screaming! Right when I look over @LOCATION1 is getting dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I'm trying to bring her back up I feel someone grabbing my feet! There I go, right where @LOCATION1 is! We kept trying to hide,@CAPS6 get back up on the bed, but we eventually gave up because our plan didn't work that well. All of a sudden my feet were tied together! Then my hands @CAPS6 mouth! @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room @CAPS6 hitting us, she thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world! She was laughing @CAPS3 hard, especially when we kept trying to get back on the bed with tied hands @CAPS6 feet.  After an hour of struggling me @CAPS6 @LOCATION1 had an idea! We thought if we hid in the bathroom she couldn't get us anymore @CAPS6 we would try to un-tie each others bandannas @CAPS6 ropes. But before we could do that @PERSON1 beat us to it! She had thrown us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. "@LOCATION1 @CAPS8 is that noise? " I said. "@CAPS4 the bath!" she said. We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON1 picked us up @CAPS6 threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming yelling for each other. @CAPS6 for help!   When we got out of the bathtub she threw us back up on the bed @CAPS6 finally untied our bandannas @CAPS6 ropes! After she turned the light back on we looked at our wrists @CAPS6 ankles @CAPS6 there was red marks all over them. @LOCATION1 said "@CAPS5! Your crazy, we told you to stop @CAPS6 you didn't!" @CAPS6 right after she screamed that @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walks in. "@CAPS8 is all the yelling for girls?" @CAPS6 then it all came out! In the end @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble @CAPS6 we got out of it. @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I learned a huge lesson. Never "play a game" with your older sister when she has bandannas @CAPS6 ropes!

@PERSON1                               @CAPS1 @CAPS2 One @DATE1 of @DATE1 break me and a @CAPS3 went @CAPS1 with my @CAPS5 on the boat in @LOCATION1. We have been waiting all week for to go catch some @DATE1 @CAPS4 salmon. That @DATE3 @TIME1 we had to get the boat ready so we can leave that day. Our boat is big so we just put all our stuff in it, like sleeping bags, coolers of food, and all the @CAPS1 gear we would need for salmon. we also brought a camp stove for our food we make on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2 but we call him big @PERSON2 hes very funny guy that provided a lot of laughter on the boat.When we get there we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon.  We leave and soon as we get to the boat ramp were we launch the boat my @CAPS5 realizes that he forget to get hooks while we were at the shop. So we pull the boat out of the water, luckily the boat was still on the trailer, we get all the stuff all secure in the boat again and leave to the shop. Right as we get to the bait place the lady we talk to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought, some how we did forget I don't know how though. So we say thanks and headed back to the river. We finally get our boat in the water and head up river to were we are going to do our @CAPS1, and it is a popular place there would be a line of boats called a hog line and some how we would always some how get in the middle where the best @CAPS1 is. There would be some days usually @DATE2 like @NUM1 boats on each side of us and it got hectic and some times funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat.  When we got there after we geared our poles up we put them out in the water, my pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS4 and fought him for about fifth teen minutes and my @CAPS5 netted it and it was a keeper fish. After all that my @CAPS5 said that was a small fish. Right around dark we reeled are poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark it was time for bed and it was quite on the river there was no one on the river besides so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind burn, because last time we went we got wind burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. finally my buddies pole goes down and hes all excited about hooking a fish, about ten minutes go by and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by, me and my @CAPS5 knew he hooked on it but we didn't want to say any thing because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS5's pole goes down and it was fish on, so i throw the anchor out we float down get it in the net another fish too take home and we had two in the boat but my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home.  After all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week. Right about two o clock, I look over my pole tip slams to the water another fish on hand it to my buddy he's fighting it, he was having trouble reeling though because the drag was tight but then i fix it he gets in the boat, his first salmon ever he was happy. perfect timing, because about fifteenth minutes later we leave to go home. the @CAPS2 was fun we got some fish, we had some funny moments, and most of all I got my buddy his first salmon.

 There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient. My family is always laughing. We could be laughing at a movie, or a joke someone just made. We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us. The same thing can be said about me and my friends. My friends and I laugh at almost anything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless. I can remember one @DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We all packed up our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot. Once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, "I'll race you down to the lake!" @CAPS1 took about five steps before @CAPS1 stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and @CAPS1 fell flat on his face. Everyone started busting up laughing, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up @CAPS1 was laughing too. We spent the rest of the @DATE1 swimming and making fun of his fall, the best part about it was @CAPS1 joked around too.  That night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and smores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out. over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, took hikes in the woods, fished for a little while, and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time. On the @DATE1 that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one @DATE1 hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. To us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next. Before going down we all took a "potty break" as one of my friends called it, the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what @CAPS1 thought was an empty hole. As it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us @CAPS1 didn't realize this until it was too late. Wasps began pouring out of there home searching for whoever was disturbing them, which happened to be us. My screamed in horror, "@CAPS2 crap its a bees nest!" The next thing I knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants. Running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way. As they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all @CAPS1 while they were being stung by the wasps.  We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till we cried. Once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened. My friends and I still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this @DATE1. I still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and I am looking forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless.

 My alarm went on at @TIME1. It was another normal @DATE1 for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the @CAPS1 time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and @NUM2 hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION2, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed "home". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, @NUM3 minutes out of town, and without public transportations. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the @CAPS1 weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principle. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS1 meeting the following @DATE2. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes.  Finally my @CAPS1 day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my @CAPS1 day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it @NUM1 times my locker won't open.  "@CAPS1 spin it @NUM1 times right, go to the @CAPS1 number, go left, pass the second number once...", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my @CAPS1 day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later.  Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made.

 He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after @DATE1 and @PERSON2 and I had just fixed our off and on relationship. He had picked @CAPS1 up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked @CAPS1 up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell @CAPS1, but not today. Today he was quite, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to @CAPS1 and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant "I'm not in the mood so just stop".  We were watchingDespicable @CAPS1 for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was @PERSON2's step mom. The were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out to late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear to well and I was paying attention to @PERSON2 to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless then I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he do something to help @CAPS1 decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his step mom's friend, @PERSON1. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but @PERSON2's dad, @PERSON3, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. @PERSON1 had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @PERSON2 jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was "that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!" from @PERSON2's step mom. @PERSON2 got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to @CAPS1, he laid @CAPS1 down and cuddled with @CAPS1.   There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someones crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. @PERSON3 was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, @PERSON2 finally looked at @CAPS1, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dads third wife that had just walked out the door.   "@CAPS2, that's hell and really scary. Promise @CAPS1 WE will @CAPS3 fight like that?" I said. I had @CAPS3 heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared @CAPS1, I would @CAPS3 want that kind of thing going on in my house.  "I promise."he smiled.  I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled @CAPS1 back down and kissed my nosed, I looked at him and smiled " @CAPS4, I really really gotta pee." That was all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day.

  Dog @CAPS1 Of @DATE1  @CAPS2 made me laugh every time I saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. @CAPS2 was my best friend, my dog. @CAPS3 brought me happiness every moment I was with her. Barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night. All the crazy stuff that amazing dog did, brought a smile to my face. The laughter and joy to my heart.  Every @DATE1 when we went camping with the @PERSON1 family, we had to bring her with us. We had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake,@CAPS2 would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other families dog @PERSON2, @CAPS3 would carry her own leash like in her mouth like I would've been holding it. Every little thing @CAPS2 did differently than the average dog made us laugh. @CAPS2 was "@CAPS4," as we called her. @CAPS3 also loved to "log." @CAPS2 pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but back. All of the grandparents loved her too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because @CAPS2 didn't like just any cookie. The time @CAPS2 went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard his eyes started to water. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to "@CAPS6-sit," @CAPS3. Che loved her so much. When @CAPS2 was there @CAPS2 didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, @CAPS2 got the couch. @CAPS2 would take @CAPS3 into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park.  I taught her to do tricks like the @LOCATION1 where @CAPS2 bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her @CAPS16 to speak. I would say "@CAPS9's on top a house?" "@CAPS10. (@CAPS11)," "who was the greatest @CAPS12 player ever?" "@CAPS10 (@CAPS14 @CAPS15)," and "@CAPS16 does sandpaper feel?" "@CAPS10." That made everyone laugh. We would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard.  Our family took her on @CAPS9 we called "@CAPS3 @CAPS1," to the river to go swim and fish with us. @CAPS2 had fun running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach.We took her everywhere with us, and @CAPS2 loved it. @CAPS2 was also the only dog at the park that knew @CAPS16 to slide. Everyone was so amazed at @CAPS9 @CAPS2 could do. They had never seen anything like her before.  @CAPS3 made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @CAPS2 was my best friend and the smartest dog I knew. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @CAPS2 made me laugh. @CAPS2's gone now, but her memory still remains. @CAPS2 will never be forgotten.

Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a "hoot and a holler" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people".

 A @CAPS1 time ago when I was about @NUM1 years old. I had moved to @LOCATION1, after @NUM2 weeks went by @CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS2 age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said "here!" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 "replied yea what bout you?" I "told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church. I told em @CAPS3. later on that day I told @CAPS2 older brother @CAPS4, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE1 I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON1 who goes to are church, @CAPS2 brother @CAPS4 told me oh... @PERSON1 goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS6 said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS2 older brother knew @CAPS6 was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS6 didn't tell me @CAPS6 knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS6 said " cause you didn't ask" I was like... Oh..... Me and @CAPS2 brother started to laugh cause i didn't know @PERSON1 was @CAPS2 older brother friend and @CAPS6 laughed at me cause I never asked him if @CAPS6 knew anyone that played yu-gi-oh card game.
<START>

 It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked "@CAPS1?""@CAPS2" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face."@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny" I demanded throwing a smile back at him."@CAPS2 is funny, but.." @CAPS6 paused for a moment."@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. "@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him" I thought to my self. "@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap."@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.." I paused for a long time."@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out."@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying "Was I not clear enough" or "@CAPS12 I just walk away?".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!."@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9" I said feeling relived."@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives "happily ever after". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. "@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1" I asked noticing his not @CAPS14 happy expression. "I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out" @PERSON1 said. "@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. "@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?" @CAPS6 grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. "uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. @CAPS14 i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS1 was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it.

  In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, @PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, "he is going to hurt you" and "he's not worth your tears." I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that @DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for @DATE1, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because @DATE1 was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was "don't believe what you hear, believe what you see." I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh.

  Laughter is the only expression in my opinion to always be positive. My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six pack, it works your muscles. @CAPS3 is very important in a relationship. If @CAPS5 don't have any kind of sense of humor, consider yours self inhumane. When it comes to my family, I am always @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is always positive and happiness follows is in life. If I have a problem I think of something that would make me laugh, a laugh is always nice..  Relationships can be created by having things in common, see my dad and I don't always get along. When we laugh everything else is silent, it sets the mood. If @CAPS5 didn't laugh around my dad he would ask "@CAPS1 @CAPS5 got a sore sense of humor?" @CAPS2 again if your not @CAPS3 with me at something funny, @CAPS5 must be an outsider. @CAPS3 is positive and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot, I laugh out loud. @CAPS5 would not have the relations @CAPS5 have @DATE1 if it wasn't for @CAPS3. Some people say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with that statement. If it wasn't for laughter I think that I would be very negative, I would be disciplined more and to think I would be more distant with my dad. As I grow older I see me maturing, I laugh a lot less... My dad also see's the change, we have grown further apart witch is normal with every teenager growing up. My dad is very funny, and even know I'm glad to be growing up I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relations I have with my dad. Laughter is all around, I see people walking down the street @CAPS3 on their cell phone. I hear of the phrase "@CAPS3 all the way to the bank," I would be @CAPS3 if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if @CAPS5 are not @CAPS3 and happy in life then money doesn't mean a thing. I could be poor and @CAPS3, and still be happy. If @CAPS5 are not happy in life then everything @CAPS5 have or worked for means nothing. Laughter brings people togethe,r @CAPS2 is no doubt. I've met many people by just simply "@CAPS3." @CAPS5 will be surprised what @CAPS5 can get by just putting a smile on your face, or if @CAPS5 find something funny, "@CAPS6." I have a very humorous dad, I would not change it. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe that everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it, it's unfortunate not everyone is happy in life, so why don't @CAPS5 personally go out of your way and make someone laugh? @CAPS5 don't know their situation, it is nearly possible a laugh can take @CAPS5 many places. @CAPS5 never know what a laugh will bring @CAPS5 until @CAPS5 find out? Laughter is a strong element in relations, and can base a personality profile of someone and who they are.

Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it.

                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said "can i see your feet?" "@CAPS6" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said "did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?" I looked at him with a dumb face and said "@CAPS6". He just had a great big smile and said, "go wash your feet". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner.

 i woke up at @NUM1 from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before. after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could. once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one i got wasn't what i expected. right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes. i got kinda mad at him because i didn't know what he was laughing at , until i looked down and realized i had no pants on, i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake. i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke, they didn't believe me at all, i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.    after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing iv done like that,i replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met .in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i.

 In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS9. We @CAPS8 every day, make jokes,smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role.@CAPS9 all started @DATE1 in @DATE2. I was living in @LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION2 for one @DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paper work... One of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking foreign language with group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine.I remember that day as if @CAPS9 was yesterday. Everything in details. @CAPS9 was @DATE3 @TIME1, when I came into the white big building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be.I came in the class and two @CAPS1 introduces us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer then the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger then the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair were. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE1. Another girl was a complete "barbie girl". You know, typical @CAPS3- two good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like " @CAPS4, I am the best one here". Nothing else about her, just @CAPS3. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rep companies @ORGANIZATION2 shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in @LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and i was able to hear music from his I-pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching @CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else.I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS1 who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us.They gave us a random word, something like " jungadzhumba" and told us to think about what @CAPS9 is and to perform @CAPS9. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that @CAPS9 is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about @CAPS9. Yes, just a joke, and i do not even remember what @CAPS9 was, the only thing is that @CAPS9 was really funny. We started to @CAPS8. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but @CAPS9 seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... @CAPS9 was wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard @CAPS9 before, but the real understanding was at that @DATE3. Now my favorite phrase is: "@CAPS8, if you don't know what to do, just @CAPS8!" @CAPS9 will help you.

Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS1 feel good, @CAPS1 feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  "@CAPS1 don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out."I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS1 are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS1 want to do? I don't think @CAPS1 would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS1 would want your friends or family make @CAPS1 laugh, so @CAPS1 can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS2 fine, @CAPS4 I @CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, "@CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes @CAPS1 feel way better in the end." I mean, @CAPS1 @MONTH1 feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS1 can @CAPS2 laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS2 be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS1 have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS1 can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS3 sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a "blonde." @CAPS3 says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  "@CAPS4 @CAPS1 laugh a lot. @CAPS1 will live life longer."I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS1 can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter.

Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. "@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. "@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7."  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my "@CAPS9" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: "@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to "catch up on life." For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. "@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?" my @CAPS3 suggested. "@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter.

 One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so then he put it back. Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me.  He said to me "hey where is the hat you stole from my store?" "I didn't steal a hat bro" I answered back. "@CAPS1 you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat." said the guy. " @CAPS2 dude I did not take a hat" I replied. "@CAPS3.k. then what about your brother, where is he?" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop.  "I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is @CAPS2 reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it.

                                   @DATE2 I woke up on a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS5 one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was @CAPS5 one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS5 one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. @CAPS7 was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day.  @CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS7 couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS7, the less @CAPS7 made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS7 up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. "@CAPS1've reached @ORGANIZATION1," a woman on the phone said. " @CAPS2 @MONTH1 I help @CAPS1?" "@CAPS3, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. "@CAPS4, are @CAPS1 still there?" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? "Was @CAPS7 something that I said?" I asked. "@CAPS5, @CAPS5, I'm so sorry," @CAPS8 said, trying to keep herself from laughing. " @CAPS5, @CAPS7's just that, do @CAPS1 know what day is today?" "@CAPS7's @DATE3, isn't @CAPS7?" @CAPS8 laughed again. "@CAPS5, today isn't @DATE3, @CAPS7's @DATE2." I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS7 was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years.

                                           "Laughter" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out "@NUM1 points!" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too.

 People say "laughter can cure anything", @CAPS6 you know what I totally believe it to. There has been multiple times when I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I have made almost everyone I know laugh when they were down our frustrated. Now, many people have made me laugh throughout my whole sixteen years that i have been alive. To be completely honest, I only really remember one moment in my life that really laughter was all I needed to pull me back to reality. My best friend @PERSON2 really knew what i need to help me out. her humor made my life real again, and because of it I was able to except life. It was @DATE1, when I got really upset because I knew that the guy I loved since seventh grade wouldn't date me again. His reason for this was because he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said that didn't mean I would just give up. I tried @CAPS2 to win him back, but it just seemed like nothing was working. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend, so I text-ed @PERSON2. I told her @CAPS2 I was doing, and how none of it was working. If you knew @PERSON2, you would know that @CAPS1 sees a bright side to anything @PERSON2 told me at that time, "@PERSON1, you can have any guy ion the world, and yet, you can't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really @CAPS3 sick!" @CAPS1 said that once or twice because @CAPS1 knew it was true. I still just couldn't except what @CAPS1 was telling me. that never stopped me from smiling or laughing though. I'll admit those words really dried my tears up. and helped me move forward. Now it is @DATE2 time, school is out, and it's time for me to step my game up. I was still trying to win @PERSON3, the @CAPS3 of my life back. Once again I tried @CAPS2! I even asked @PERSON2 to ask @PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @PERSON2 for more advice, @CAPS1 responded like usual. "@PERSON1, @PERSON3 is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to look and stop trying for just one guy". This got me thinking. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 is totally right, I just need to find a guy that makes me feel the same way @PERSON3 makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @PERSON2 was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little, and giggle. As I was giggling, I though t to myself. I still @CAPS3 @PERSON3 like crazy. It's the beginning of @DATE2, and I am just relaxing at my house like usual, when I get a text from @PERSON3 saying he might be moving to @LOCATION1. I just started bawling like a baby who is hungry. I quickly text ed @PERSON2 to tell her, but @CAPS1 already knew. I had one more plan to win @PERSON3 back, and I told @PERSON2 all about it. My plan is to ask @PERSON3 if he wants to hike @CAPS4. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we hiked all the way to the top I am going to tell him how I truly still feel about him, then I am going to kiss him.m @CAPS5 @PERSON2 read this, her first response was, " @CAPS6 shoot girly, aren't you just a spitball of @CAPS3 and romance!" I almost peed my pants when I read that. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @PERSON3 ended up not moving thankfully. Quintin and I still haven't got back together, but I am fine with that. His and I's friendship has grown tremendously. I'll admit though that I can't help but flirt with him a lot. Luckily though, I had my best friend @PERSON2 to talk to. @CAPS1 is the reason my tears and moans turned to tears of happiness and laughter. @PERSON2's humor brought me to except-ants. laughter kept me in perspective of @CAPS2. I owe all my thanks to @PERSON2, who kept me from going insane or crazy about @CAPS2. Laughter helped mend my heart, and change my whole life dramatically.

 I slowly got up and watched as paint dripped off my face, my hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make @CAPS5 to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. "@CAPS1...Hey mom?" I yelled half-halfheartedly, as I glanced back at the "painted" room.  "@CAPS2?" she hollered back up the stairs.My mouth wouldn't open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up millions of times, but none have been this bad.  "@CAPS3, you see... I've had a paint withdraw from the paint pan." I replied softly, hoping she would not hear me.  "A paint withdraw?" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what has happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a rant about how I have to be more careful, and punishment. Neither came. She started to crack up.  I was @CAPS8 confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to giggle as I took in the situation, only something like this would happen to me. Minutes later we finial got a hold of ourselves and mom went to go get some paper towels to clean up my mess.  She came back upstairs carrying a role of paper towels and a plastic garbage bags."@CAPS4 thing I put the plastic covering over everything, before I let you paint." she stated, smiling at me. "@CAPS5 would have been way worse, if I spilled the paint all over the carpet." I replied, returning her smile. I started to gather up the plastic covering, revealing the unsoiled carpet. The garbage-can was as full as a stuffed @LOCATION1 on @CAPS6. After we gathered up the last of the plastic covering, I slammed the garbage-cans lid as I put the last bit of plastic covering in. My mom came in carrying @CAPS7, and a handful of paper-towels.  "@CAPS8 what made the paint pan have sudden withdraw of paint, @CAPS9?, @CAPS10 you trip on the plastic covering, or drop the paintbrush in the pan?" she questioned me, as she gave me a confused facial expression.  I didn't know what to say. " I...@CAPS1, @CAPS3, I was on my way to paint the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Landing in the paint pan and receiving the paintbrush in my face" I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom always got on me, for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started to laugh uncontrollably again. She started to turn beat-red. I could not believe her reaction. The situation was @CAPS8 funny, I started to laugh again as-@CAPS3. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined anyone forgiving me in such a big way.  Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning the mess. My mom and I remember this day as a time we got to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand, and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how big they are.

@CAPS1 @CAPS2   @CAPS3 in to the school's office was a usual thing for me. I was only in elementary school and had already developed the habit of making myself sick" so I could go home. It had worked several @CAPS2 but the reality was that some how adults could outsmart "my sickness". As a kid I was a perfect actor but apparently my acting skills were fading. All the staff new me by then and by now it was harder for me to make my ways out. I remember being in forth grade when I made an appearance at the office but not really by choice and in my innocence I never knew what could happen next. My cousin @PERSON2 and I were in the same classes, we used to look alike when we were kids and teachers would often confuse who we were because we looked like twins. One day my cousin was struggling with a couple math problems and @PERSON1, our math teacher decided to stay a few minutes after school to help her. However we also use to ride the same bus and I decided to wait for her in order to catch the bus together. Those few minutes became more and once @PERSON2 was out we had already missed the bus. That's when we made our appearance in the office and there she was the chunky old lady that new me by heart. I would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer and filling out some papers.This time she knew it wasn't one of those "wanna go home" days. "We missed the bus" we said, she then asked us why, we both gave our explanations. In the meantime she called @PERSON1 to make sure we were telling the truth. When @PERSON1 showed up, the office lady explained what we had said, but the problem was that she confused our explanations thinking we both missed the bus for the same reason making me look like a liar. When @PERSON1 heard this she said that I wasn't telling the truth and when I tried to explain to her that the lady had been mistaken there was no use even my cousin tried to defend me but the office lady said she was sure of what I had said. Being a kid and all I felt ashamed even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs. @PERSON1 decided to give me a demerit but deep inside I knew I said the truth and that's what matters.   As a kid it seems like the end of the world in these situations. Feeling anger because I wasn't able to do anything about it but now that I look back it brings a smile to my face because in my poor judgment I could just think of the teacher as being mean but now I see that it was just a big misunderstanding. Now around @NUM1 years have passed and this memory is still with me but I only get the best of it. When I hang out with my cousin @PERSON2 the base of our conversations are these funny moments of our childhood that only bring laughter, just remembering the foolish things we did when we were young. Sharing these moments bring us closer not only as a family but as friends and there is no better thing than enjoying moments of long lasting laughter with the people we love."

 Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day

 My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue.

 In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience "hot flashes," and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of "speech giving time," (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the "actors." @CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different, @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said "@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening." @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting.

                                 Love in @LOCATION1 was a small boy, who didn't have very much ambition in life, he was taunted and teased to the point where he would just hide away in his house and not talk to anyone. The other boys at school would laugh at @ORGANIZATION1 for being so much smaller than themselves. He was never the fastest, strongest, or coolest but he was the smartest. He knew how to twist and turn any phrase to make himself feel superior to others. @ORGANIZATION1 was in truth lonely, he had never laughed or felt the cool touch of a lover. He wished dearly that he could be more outgoing to the point where a girl would fall in love with him. There was in fact a girl he had his eye on for months, her name was @PERSON1. She was the most beautiful girl he had have laid eyes on. He had followed her all over town, and rode his bicycle past her almost everyday when she was with her friend @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 hated @CAPS1 for he had gotten to be with @PERSON1 everyday, and got to hold her and talk to her. @ORGANIZATION1 had envied @CAPS1 for around four months before he had messaged her on a website called "myyeabook" a place to meet new people and make friends. @ORGANIZATION1 had sent her a friend request and asked for her digits. Hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her. @PERSON1 accepted his request and sent him a message saying "@CAPS4 I see your from the town next to mine, we should hang out sometime it would be cool." @ORGANIZATION1 had almost lost it when he had read this, he went and got a hair cut, and new clothes just so that she would think he was attractive and cool. @PERSON1 had went to the park with her friend @PERSON2 and waited for this fellow named @ORGANIZATION1. She and @PERSON2 had played on the swings, and spun each other on the spinning wheel. @ORGANIZATION1 had been riding his bike and set it down a hundred yards away from where they were. He walked over said "@CAPS4." to @PERSON2 and proceeded to walk over to @LOCATION2. He told her he thought she was beautiful and had an amazing smile. @PERSON1 blushed and asked him if he wanted to swing for a while. @PERSON2 took off home, seeing that @PERSON1 was going to be okay with this guy, and little did they know, they were made for each other. @ORGANIZATION1 let his guard down and told her some jokes, he laid out his life story almost with her, he was so comfortable around her and he didn't know why. @PERSON1 felt the same way, she laughed at his jokes, and told him her life story. In this one short meeting they had connected on a level that was far from their ages. @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERSON1 was smart, and loved to be outdoors, she was practically the female version of himself. After a month of conversation and hanging out off and on, @ORGANIZATION1 sent @PERSON1 a text message saying "@CAPS6 you down to be my partner in life?" @PERSON1 was stunned and excited that @ORGANIZATION1 wanted her to be his girlfriend. @PERSON1 simply replied "@CAPS6 you down to be mine?" @ORGANIZATION1 replied back to her "I love you." @PERSON1 was the happiest girl in the world that night of @DATE1, @NUM1 @DATE2. The two went everywhere together and did everything together, everyone knew that they were perfect for each other. @PERSON1 began to fall in love with @ORGANIZATION1 and after four months of being together told him finally. @ORGANIZATION1 was so elated that he went out and bought her a ring, and she graciously accepted it. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 moved in together and started a family. A little laughter can go a long way, in anything you do, a job, a family, or even in the hopes of finding your perfect someone. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 found that their love had come from that day many months ago in that park, laughing about even the smallest of things such as a corny joke, or an adventure of another can lead the way to a lifetime of true love. All it takes is a little bit of laughter.

 Moving schools is never easy, especially for a fourth grader. I had been dreading going back to a new school all @DATE2 and the day had arrived. My @CAPS1 reassured me as I reluctantly walked onto the bus. As I scanned the seats it became apparent to me that I needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner. The bus ride was a quiet one, I did not talk to anyone nor did they talk to me. The school day started like any other. First the teacher assigned everyone their seats in groups of two, I sat by a boy named @PERSON1. At first I thought my school life would remain a solo one, I wasn't sure what my seating partners problem was but no words were being exchanged. The rest of the day went by rather fast, before I knew it it was over. I had made it though my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different than the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house my mother was there to ask how my day went. After telling her all about it she said that I should try to just be myself and eventually I would make friends. It was @DATE1, I got up that morning with a sense of new found motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, I kept waiting for almost a half hour before I went to my mom. After phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get into the car and she would take me to school, just as we were pulling out of our driveway I notice @PERSON1, my seating partner, was waiting at his bus stop oblivious to what had happened. Screeching to a halt my mom rolled down her window to ask him if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed unsure but he took us up on the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We made it to school and me and @PERSON1 start walking to class. I don't know what got into me but I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting down the sidewalk while @PERSON1 is watching, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a major bump on my head I turn around to see @PERSON1 laughing hysterically. I got somewhat mad at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the onlookers. Scraping my self off the cement I walk over to @PERSON1, We laugh about the incident and head to class. That day we spent the entire class talking, even getting into trouble a time of two. Ever since that day @PERSON1 has been a good friend of mine, its been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight. Overall in my opinion laughter is an important part of daily life, and a great way to make friends.

 When I was young me and my friends would play at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a @CAPS2 in the middle of a orchard, there was a slide, diving bored, and two rope swings. All @DATE1 long we would sit, play, swim, and laugh down at the @CAPS2. We would have are @CAPS4 day party, and calibrate the @CAPS5 of @DATE2 down at the @CAPS2. There is one day I can remember so well that its like it was yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus stopped at the @CAPS2 we all started running and striping down to are swim trunks. I was the first one in, as a result I was the first one to relies the water was as cold as the river, it felt like a thousand little nettles stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncy ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips the all started laughing so hard that some of them fell in to the freezing water themselves. After that we walked you to @CAPS1 house and asked him to turn on the generator, after about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim in. After a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing. After a while we started doing back flips, when we stopped are backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and are throats hurt from laughter. As well as being sore from hitting the water over and over again, we were also hungry so we fired up the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches resembled a mound of coal, we decided to order pizza. We spent the time by air soft, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of air soft @CAPS7's floating in it. As we ate we sat on the small dock and stuck are legs in and collected what ever @CAPS7's came near. Soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all scraped up by running throw the trees, so of course we pored soda on are cuts, to this day I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt. Once we were done being stupid we laughed at are self's, then we laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we played swimming base ball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating plat form. we used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the @CAPS2 and roasted marshmallows over it. When are @CAPS9 came to get us we were in the middle of a belly-flop contest. Before we left we promised that we would never forget that day, and that we would be friends forever and laughter would always be the glue. That night I stayed up all night thinking of all the fun and all the laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and one of the most memorable summers of my life.

  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives.

 When I was fourteen years old I think my family and I started riding four wheelers out in the sand. My parents friends are the one who got us started riding. The first time I went out there I had a @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION2 four wheeler and i couldn't stop laughing because it was so small and everybody had big four wheelers and dirt bikes, but riding out there with that thing was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother rode it up a hill because he would just ride the crap out of that thing. After that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION1. Its the first time going to the dunes with my new four wheeler and I can't wait. We get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on. It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four wheeler when some people showed up and was video taping him, which made him show off a little bit. So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out jump him. So when he got don't jumping the guys who were video taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump.So my brother trying to be cool whipped his bike around and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash. So we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight. I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I look ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face, which made me turn my handle bars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air rolled off a little little hill and landed on my leg, my brother didn't knew he did that to me so I was stranded until my parents came. I don't know why but i couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get that four wheeler off my leg.  About ten minutes passed by with my four wheeler on my leg and I finally heard a loud noise it was my dad and he came to save me so I told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roosted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that my brother doesn't roost me anymore.  It's been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roosted me. He still tends to show off. This one time my moms friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mom. He looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off he wrecks, so why does he keep doing it? I don't know why but maybe he should stop sometime so he doesn't wreck every time we go out there. Just kidding it doesn't bother me when he wrecks because they are usually funny. I thinks that's why we have so much fun out there because of him.

 Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me "for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life." That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself "he @MONTH1 never get to do again." We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and "@CAPS6 it up" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away.

Many things are said to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods to fashion taste or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing will always lighten the mood, bring out a winning smile and from time to time, a tear to the eye. Laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. By 'good laugh', I @CAPS5't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach. The kind of laugh that you remember. I've had many of those moments, but one that I cherish most just happened to occur during a school day. A couple weeks ago I was having a pretty nice day, sure its @CAPS1 so the weather dampened my spirits a little, but I was doing alright. I had my normal classes, got my average homework load, and then it came time for @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is basically study hall at my school. I sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything. Everyday, I sit by @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I occasionally sit and talk with everyone else, but we tend to disingage ourselfs from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes, smart ass laughs and people watching. So that day during @CAPS2, I can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table, we all just couldn't keep ourselfs from laughing. Most of the laughing was just giggles, and some of it was straight up, hardcore red faced laughing. After we all settled down from the most recent up roar of chuckling, @PERSON1 started talking. She somehow spit out the words, "@CAPS4 it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!" amoungst the giggles still blossoming out of her mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled.I just stared at her and stuttered, "...what?". I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after she replied with "@CAPS5't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to pee! See, the funny part is, @PERSON1 is @CAPS6. So the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny. After @PERSON1 and I caught our breath, we asked other @CAPS7 around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what? They @CAPS8! This only made us laugh harder. This occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure.That inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones, and it being funny, just makes it funnier! Everytime she laughs I ask, "@CAPS8 your eyes hurt?" and we just burst into more laughter. The idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face, that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, actually it brings just about every possitive emotion. I @MONTH1 not be a doctor yet, but I know I'm right when I say; everyone should get their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can cure just about anything.

 It was the @DATE1 and my friend @PERSON1 was going to come home with @CAPS2. We talked about our plans for the week all @DATE1 at @DATE1. Some of our ideas that we had thought up included going to a movie, hanging out at my house and doing our nails while telling stories, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood. At lunch that @DATE1 we decided on trying to do all of the ideas because we had @DATE1 days to hang out. After lunch we went to our next two classes and the classes seemed to go by really slow. Finally the @DATE1 bell of the @DATE1 rang and @PERSON1 and I ran to our locker to meet up and get all of our stuff to go home.  We went outside the front doors of the @DATE1 and waited on the front steps for my mom. We waited for twenty minutes @DATE1 we remembered that my mom told @CAPS2 that we would have to walk home after @DATE1 because she had to work late. @PERSON1 and I looked over at each other and started laughing, because we had totally forgotten about having to walk home. Finally we stopped laughing and got up to walk home. On our way home we had my i-pod out and the volume turned to max so we could listen to music and dance around. We finally made it home and dropped all of our stuff off and got something to drink.  On our way to my moms work, we stopped at the local gas station to get something to eat . We left the gas station and continued to my moms work. On the way to the bank where my mom works we came across a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back and it looked like it was going to rip off. The squirrel ran up a tree that was nearby, but the dog didn't realize that he couldn't climb the trunk and ended up running head first into the tree. @PERSON1 and I started laughing at the dog because it stumbled around for a few minutes and then decided to sit down and just bark at he tree. We left the dog and squirrel and continued to the bank. We arrived at the bank twenty minutes later and talked to my mom. She gave us money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go back home. On our way home we stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 and got coffee.   On our way back to my house from @ORGANIZATION2 we watched the people drive by and laughed at all the people singing in their cars while stopped at the light. We arrived back at my house and decided to put a movie in. We watched @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and ate popcorn. Any time the little yellow people came into the movie we laughed because we both thought they were cute. After the movie my parents got home, and we had pizza and @CAPS3. Pepper for dinner. After dinner we played the wii and then fell asleep. The next @DATE1 when we woke up my dad made us pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast we got ready to go and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall my mom told @PERSON1 and I to meet her back at food court around two. We left my mom and headed to the first store. While we were walking to one of the store we saw a guy with a mowhak and a green beard. We looked at each other and started laughing because his beard looked like a @CAPS4 tree tipped over. At @NUM1-o'clock we left to go back to food court to meet up with my mom. She bought us @ORGANIZATION1 and told us that if we left now we could go see a movie. We decided to stay for one more hour and then we left to go home. On our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew.  When we arrived home we played the wii until my dad got there. After my dad got home we ate dinner and then played the wii again. This time when we played the wii we got my parents to play too. Whenever it was my moms turn we would laugh because of how she would set herself up to bowl. After we finished playing the wii @PERSON1 and I went into my room and talked about all of the guys that we liked. We laughed at some of our choices because of the reasons that we liked them. We talked for about two hours and then fell asleep. The next @DATE1 we woke up and had eggs and toast for breakfast. After breakfast @PERSON1 got dressed to go home. After she left we talked over text about all the fun we had, and how we couldn't wait for tomorrow.

 All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, "@CAPS2, I'm having fun." @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun.

 During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   "@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   "@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?" I asked him.   "@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers." @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house.

 @CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying "laughter is the best medicine." @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden "whoosh" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?

        Family trip @CAPS1 the @DATE1 my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2 who was @NUM2-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON1 who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS4 who was @NUM3-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing.

 I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why . When I first got to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and @CAPS4 came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing .The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me. So that I would laugh more an @CAPS5 felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying @CAPS5 . She was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought @CAPS5 was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny . @CAPS5 was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time. For me @CAPS5 is funny because lot's of people don't notice how other people laugh.  @CAPS5 feel good that she noticed and liked @CAPS5 and wanted to have a good time. Most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things @CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again i know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought @CAPS5 was unique and funny but not a haha you are weird funny but like a omg i love your laugh, its cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh @CAPS5 makes me feel good every time she does @CAPS5.When you are new at @CAPS3 good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly. To be honest @CAPS5 made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as "the new kid" but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as. That's all i could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships @CAPS5 shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones.  Another reason is @CAPS5 shows your personalty your real self. Isn't that what people, to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are.At least that's what i want. that's why i will never forget that class period. @CAPS4 showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the aren't laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny. That's what people want is to see people for who they are.  The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help @CAPS5 because @CAPS5 was so funny. That period i laughed the whole time. I was laughing so @CAPS8 that i peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed how I laugh she did everything to make me laugh. @CAPS5 was so funny @CAPS5 took up the whole period. That's is how much i was laughing.  I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh. So then i sat down and @CAPS7 and @PERSON1 came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at @CAPS5 and said what is that its @CAPS8. We all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny @CAPS5 was is wallet. I didn't get why they were still laughing when I stopped but then I continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing. We all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause @CAPS5 was funny.The sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again. I think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff. I turned around to do my work and then @CAPS4 spinned me around so that i would start laughing again. Then i started laughing again @CAPS5 I started crying. I was laughing so @CAPS8. @CAPS4 started laughing so @CAPS8 that she started laughing. At the end of the period I had to pee so bad. @CAPS4 wouldn't let me go she just kept on making me laugh more and more. Sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guss my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do. Not only is @CAPS5 fun but @CAPS5 is also a very healthy thing to do.

 I have been waiting a whole year for @TIME1 day to come, @DATE1. Today is my birthday! I just cant wait to open presents and eat cake. I am turning @NUM1 and all my friends are coming over and everything. It should be a great day! First I have to wait for my mom to @CAPS2 home from work. So today I am going to go swimming then going to go on a hike then finally my friends can come over and the party we start. We will have games, presents and cake. My mom said my sister were automatically invited but I dont like that rule. Maybe next birthday @CAPS1 can uninvited them.  My mom is at work. She left at @TIME1 and me and my sister just ate breakfast now we are going to go swimming. We have a pool right beside the patio in the front yard. Sometimes when my sister is mad she just throws me in. Other times she just does it because she is bigger then me and she can. My older sister @PERSON1 friend @PERSON2 was spending the week with us because she had moved away over the @DATE2 and decided she would come visit. Thats when they decided to start throwing me in the pool. One would always grab my legs the other would grab my arms and they would swing me until they just t threw me in the pool. well I got mad after it kept happening and threw a fit and cried. @PERSON1 told me if i was going to acting like a baby then i deserved to be treated like one, so she put me in a diaper and in the highchair and forced me to eat baby food. Of course I was crying now because I do not like baby food and to be in a highchair or be put in a diaper.  By @TIME1 time i didnt want to go on a hike and was just wanting my mom to be home. Finally my mom was home and even better she brought pizza. I was so excited that she did because all my friends were coming over and pizza was perfect.My mom change out of her work clothes then she decided it was time for me to take a nap. well I am @NUM1 i dont need a nap so thats when knew something was up. now that I decided it was @CAPS3 I went and took a nap and actually really did fall asleep. my mom at @TIME1 time cleaned, decorated and went and got all my friends. when i woke up and walked out of the living room mom and all my friends screamed "surprise" and I was definitely surprised. After a long fun party it was time that we cleaned up and put all the garbage away and the cake in the over so no flies would @CAPS2 to it. The next day my mom went back to work and I swam and played all day! It was a great day got to wear my new swim suit and got to also play with my new floaty toys I got. I got a lot of @DATE2 stuff. then, me and my little sister @PERSON3 were trying to find a way to @CAPS2 hot water into the pool but we were having trouble because the house didnt fit to the faucet at the bathroom. so thats when we went to my moms room and used the bathtub and put the hose all the way out the back door. We definitely accomplished that mission! By @TIME1 time we heard a lot of craziness and I went to go see what was going on and it was smoky all over. I went into the kitchen and my sister yelled" @CAPS2 your sisters and @CAPS2 out of the house meet you at the road" I ran and got them and then i saw fire trucks speeding up the drive way and here comes my mom racing over and she was freaking out making sure everyone was @CAPS3.  In the end I found out that she had burn my birthday cake trying to preheat the over for pizza. I was kinda upset that it was burnt but now I am @CAPS3 with it because I look back and laugh because my sister to @TIME1 day still has the burnt spoon and the lock. the lock is from our gate it was a simple dummy lock and the fire fighters didnt know so they just cut the chains. I guess the lesson learned here is that before you preheat the over you should always make sure nothing is in there.

 Gym clothes @CAPS1  People say laughter can bring together anyone. I do not know if that is true but, I do know that it can bring together two very unlikely @CAPS1 . Me and my best friend are complete opposite yet we became best @CAPS1 over a simple joke in the locker room. It happened on a @TIME1 that was not going to great for me, or her. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 I had to go to school. I had woken up late just the missed, walked all the way to school and had already dropped my lunch in the hallway about three times when, I walked straight into @PERSON1. (my soon to be best friend) "@CAPS2 where your going." she said to me in a catty voice and stuck me with a pointed glare. Me being shy, i just ducked my head and kept walking. @PERSON1 was one of the prettiest girls in school and hung out with the " In " clique I, well I didn't. Most of the time I hung out by my self.  Her @TIME1 had been going just about as well as mine was. Her @CAPS3 had broken up with her ,for her best friend, at the time,she also had stayed the night in the hospital with her brother who had been in a car accident. So she was in the same mood I was.What was even worse was our next class was @CAPS4.E.! I got into the locker room and as soon as I walked in I realized I had forgotten my gym clothes. @PERSON1 had just entered behind me and by the sigh she let out I knew she had forgotten hers to . We were going to have to use some from the bucket...  The bucket was where all lost or unwanted items ended up @CAPS5 there was cool stuff like sweat shirts and @CAPS5 neat tee shirts but you could never be sure if they were clean. Today though, it looked like there was only guy clothes. I walked over to the bucket and @PERSON1 came over next to me. We both began to dig through the bucket. Finding nothing but over sized sweat pants and extra large shirts we @CAPS6 out the ones we thought were the best. We changed and as soon as our eyes met we both started cracking up. We looked like two little kids playing in their dads clothes. She could not let go of her pants or else they would drop around her ankles and the shirt I was wearing hung down past my knees. Neither of us stopped laughing until our sides ached and there were tears running down our faces.  When the @ORGANIZATION1 teacher banged on the door we walked out of the locker room and the whole gym stared at us but we had found confidence and friendship in each other so, we didn't care. Sense that day @PERSON1 and I have been glued to each others sides as best @CAPS1. We have been through many fights but every time I think about that day in the locker room I can't help but to laugh. That is how laughter brought @PERSON1 and I to be best @CAPS1.

 Imagine this, flying past trees on a @CAPS1 @NUM1, four wheeler trying to keep up with everybody that's in front of you. That is how it was on new years eve.  We headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about @TIME1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride.  When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about @NUM4 o'clock pm. So we just hung out until @NUM5 o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about @NUM4:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about @TIME1 we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME1 or @NUM7 of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM8 in the @TIME2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at @NUM9 in the @TIME2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little @CAPS2 then headed to bed for the night.

  I believe that laughter is a healthy way to get a along with someone, and have fun! I think that the more you laugh the more fun you're having with someone or a group of people. One time me and my friend @PERSON1 were hanging out at my house and we literally couldn't stop laughing, every little thing was hilarious to us for some reason! It makes us have so much more fun together, when we can just laugh together instead of fighting. I love to laugh; all my friends call me obnoxious because I laugh all the time. I feel like if you're laughing and laughing with someone it makes you closer and it's way more healthier and better if you just laugh! For example I always want to hang out with @PERSON1 because we always laugh together and have a good time. It's like when you have a group of friends and some of them you always disagree on something or fighting, its never fun. If you have a boyfriend/girlfriend and you always laugh with her/him it just makes you want to be around them so much more, because your having a good time. Fighting just does the opposite!   I've recently realized who my good friends and who are my bad friends. Laughing is the biggest quality to have in someone. The girls I fight with are usually the ones who have no personality and are very negative and are just mad people. My friends that I do get along with we always laugh and have a good time, the only time I've got in a fight with one of my good friends is because the downers always say random stuff that's not true and hurtful so that person will be right there down with you! I have realized the more you laugh the more fun you will have and the more people want to be around you! I've also noticed that my mom and dad are completely different people. My mom is a sweetheart who always laughs and I can always have fun with. My dad on the other hand never laughs. I honestly can not remember the last time I heard him laugh. He is such a downer and no one ever wants to be around him. That's probably why my parents are divorced! You can just tell that my mom has more fun and my dad doesn't. In life you really just have to have fun do what your supposed to do and laugh. So really what I'm trying to say is laughing is a important part of any relationship; whether its with friends family dating, just anything! It's definitely a good quality to have.    If a person is always happy and always wanting to have a good time, I think its how they're raised. If you think about it I get my mom @PERCENT1 of the time and my dad @PERCENT1 of the time. Whenever I'm with my dad I'm always in a worse mood, I never want to do what he's asking. I basically want to rebel. When I'm with my mom I literally do the opposite I'm always happier and will do what she wants, and we always laugh and have a way better relationship then me and my dad do. I think laughing and being happier has a lot to do with who you look up to and how they act, and what they do. I can definitely tell my mood change from parent to parent. It has a lot to do with how the parents are raising their kids. I think as a adult you need to be a positive influence on your kid/teenager. I think its good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your kid. Life is to short to spend it hating someone, I believe you should spend your life having a good time and fulfilling your dreams, and mostly laughing.

 When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.

                                         "@CAPS1 to @CAPS2" @CAPS3 you ever seen the little signs that say, "@CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS2"? People often @CAPS3 them in their homes as a reminder on how one should @CAPS4 their life. Well, I believe that laughing is one of the most important elements you need, in order to @CAPS4 your life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, one @MONTH1 feel that they @CAPS3 an emptiness inside that they are unable to fill. Laughter has played a huge role in my life and has created some of the best memories. If luaghter was not a part of me, my life would be like a house without furniture; empty, boring, and over all, pointless. Some memories will never leave my mind, and looking back, I still @CAPS2 my brains out. My favorite, and most hilarious memory that I can think of, occurred about two years ago at my grandparents house. My family and I were staying with my grandparents for the weekend up at their house in @CAPS7, which I absolutely loved because there was so much to do there! They had go-carts, golf carts, acreage, and a gigantic swimming pool! What more could someone want? The weather was always nice and warm as well, so I had no complaints. It was a beautiful evening, my brother, his best friend, and I decided to take the golf carts out for a spin. My brother was in his own golf cart zooming by, and I was in one with his friend @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 must @CAPS3 seen something in the road because he told me to stop, then he hopped out. As he curiously made his way to the front of the golf cart, I pressed gently on the gas inching forward in a sort of fast manner just to scare him a little. As I did that, he frantically jumped on the hood like a cat that had just been frightened. I then decided to slam on the brakes, and when that happened, @PERSON1 launched off like a rocket, but then tried to hop back on the hood. I guess you could say we developed a game. I would go a few inches or so, then slam on the brakes! At that point I was practically crying from laughing so hard. That is until something very unexpected happened...I drove fast, and then stopped very quickly, but as i did so, this time @PERSON1 tripped! I didn't notice because I was carelessly driving like a maniac, but soon enough the golf cart was on top of him! All I remember hearing was a @CAPS8 @CAPS9! and then a loud shrilll. He was laying face first, cart on his back, and I had no idea what to do! My heart quickly sped up, and a gust of fear came over me. I looked to my right to find my brother rolling around on his back laughing like a hyena! I was still sitting in the golf cart, still unable to move in my state of shock. My brother finally got up and @PERSON1 was yelling, "@CAPS10't move @CAPS11!" @CAPS12 I had to do something! My brother was trying to tell me that we should lift the heavy cart from his back but in my head, I knew that both of us together wouldn't @CAPS3 been able to do that. Taking matters into my own hands, I shifted into reverse very carefully and slowly. Biting down on my lower lip, closing my eyes tightly, I pounded the gas to the ground, flying backwards off of his helpless body. Luckily no damage was done, and @ORGANIZATION1 was perfectly fine. A gigantic weight was lifted from my back and I was able to breathe again. Looking back, I am able to @CAPS2 and joke about that wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, though I am very thankful that nothing extremely harmful happened to the poor guy I dreadfully ran over that day. I can tell you one thing, as the day carried on, we had a blast. Carelessly being the great teenagers we are, and without a worry in the world; we laughed, swam, drove the golf carts, and enjoyed the wind swooping our hair up, then down, then all around. I take back two things from this crazy day. One, make smart decisions, and be prepared for the consequences that you @MONTH1 be faced with, and two, enjoy your life. @CAPS2 like there's no tomorrow. Be careless yet careful, and enjoy every second of it! I've learned that when faced with a tough decision; for example...do I roll off of my brothersfriend? or do I continue to sit here and listen to him yell? In that case I took a big leap of faith, and went with my gut instinct. Which I believe was most definitley the right decision. Go with your gut instinct in life, and @CAPS1 to @CAPS2.

                                                  Laughter  Laughter, how do you define it? The non-existence of happiness? Without laughter, @CAPS1 would be no smiles. Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up "your walls." Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: @CAPS1's those people who laugh when they cry, when @CAPS1 mad, when @CAPS1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think @CAPS1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let "it all on the line." @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter @CAPS2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @CAPS2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people.

                                Laughter @CAPS1 us @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was the @DATE1 of middle school and the entire music department was going on our @DATE1 field trip. Everyone was going to @LOCATION2 for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS16 didn't pay all your funds, then @CAPS16 were left behind. We were going to a hotel, attending a concert, and going to a @CAPS4 @CAPS5.   My friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS3 seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.   I was stuck sitting with @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS17 wanted to be back home in @LOCATION1. I never found out why @CAPS17 was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON3's accident. @CAPS17 snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS17 was okay and everyone besides @CAPS6 laughed along with her.   By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS17 replied, "We're almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so." The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS8, the bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.   Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. "@CAPS9 down. Lets get to @LOCATION2." @CAPS8 said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON1, our music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON4 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 while @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got our drinks; since we didn't want @ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION3 to buy @CAPS11. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON3 apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.   We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. " @CAPS6 was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS17 has money to buy food. We're missing fifty dollars." @CAPS13 replied. @PERSON1 then came in, "@CAPS14 up. We got a concert to attend." @CAPS15 at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON2 laughed picking @CAPS3 up. "@CAPS16'll do great." @CAPS17 said smiling. I smiled back, "@CAPS18 @CAPS16." I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.   I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Once we were there, @PERSON1 payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS19 shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS2.  I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything. Nothing stood in our way when we laughed. In the end laughing @CAPS1 us @CAPS2.

 Laughter is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughter is one of the many things I enjoy doing. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and some are quiet almost like a giggle. Not only do I enjoy it but I love that is helps me relieve stress, which is a major part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been going out for a year and three months. We met whenI was mowing my yard, and my neighbor @LOCATION1 brought him over to introduce us to each other. I mean she couldn't have brought him over at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was eighty degrees out side, I had no make-up on, and I smelled like fresh cut grass what a great first impression huh? "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 this is @PERSON1" she said with a smile. "@CAPS3 timing @CAPS4" I replied with a tone of anger in my voice. "sorry" she said, "but he said he wanted to meet you , and he wouldn't shut up about it." I looked over at him and noticed that he blushed a little and I laughed. From then on I knew that @PERSON1 and I were going to have something great together. Till this day our relationship is stronger than ever, and it's because we can make each other laugh. Now don't get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, are all still a big part and those are important too, but I think that having humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key things to a healthy and long lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have great sense of humor, and we defiantly like to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life;and when I talk to him on the phone I know my day is going to change from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know that within the first few minutes of talking to him and hearing his voice, he's going to say something funny and I can't help but to laugh. I honestly believe you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don't have laughter in your relationship, it tends to get very dull and boring. You can't be serious twenty-four seven, that's way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you will defiantly need it during your relationship so it doesn't get stressful and turn into nothing but a bunch of fighting and arguing. So in conclusion, I know your thoughts about what I just talked about might not be the same, but I hope after reading this you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter in a relationship, based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is, and also how great of a thing it is. How it relieves stress, if you have a bunch of stress in your relationship try cracking a couple jokes you will be amazed at what a little bit of laughing can do. Especially if you want to keep your relationship with your significant other happy, fun, and not only that but also full of life. Laughter is bliss

 I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, "@CAPS1!" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common.

The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over.

 Growing up with both of my parents and having my dads parents (my grandparents) has been the best thing for me. I spent a ton of time at my grandparents house when I was @CAPS3. Every @DATE1 we got out of @CAPS1 an hour early. And every @DATE1 of elementary school, my grandpa would be waiting for me to get out of school. He would pick me up and then we would go to either @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS2's for lunch. I always wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 because they had a play structure. But growing up, I became really close with my grandma and grandpa. My parents didn't need to worry about babysitters because we always had my grandparents that would take care of me. So the bond with them just got stronger and stronger. I would always do my homework with my grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do yard work or tinker on something in the garage. A lot of what I know now was taught to me by my grandparents. I was a very lucky @CAPS3 @CAPS5 to grow up having them in my life. Doing yard work with my @CAPS6 (which is what I called my grandpa when I was @CAPS3) was actually fun. I loved yard work. He taught me how to use the riding lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time i was @NUM1 years old I could start it up, mow the lawn, empty the grass from the catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny @DATE2 day, when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking @NUM2, like always. So I grabbed myself one and went and joined him because that is where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that's where we always hung out together. We're sitting there just talking, and he asks me if I hooked the hose back up to the fosit. Well of course I didn't because I wanted to go sit on the patio with my @CAPS6. So him and I walked over to the fosit to hook it back up. But for whatever reason he told me to take the nozzle end out to some flowers. Now here is a @NUM1 year old kid standing behind his @CAPS6 with the nozzle end of a hose with @CAPS6 bending over in front of me. So I did what any other @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 would do. I held the nozzle up, aimed right at that big booty of his, and pulled the trigger. After about a good @NUM4 second soaking of his bum, I dropped the nozzle and ran as fast as I could to my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well all I would say was, "@CAPS6 is gonna kill me!". Here comes @CAPS6 walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and I were standing. He had just the most straight angry look on this face. I literally thought that my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the @NUM5 of us were standing there. Me thinking that I'm going to die. And all of the sudden my grandpa gets the biggest smile on his face and both him and my grandma start cracking up. He wasn't mad, he thought it was hilarious! So of course I start laughing too!  @CAPS6 came inside and changed his now water soaked pants and underwear and then all @NUM5 of us went out on the patio and just chilled and talked and drank some great @NUM2. After a couple hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandma went inside to make dinner. So @CAPS6 and I stayed out on the patio and shot pine cones out of the tree with a @CAPS7 gun, seeing who could shoot more down before dinner was ready. Grandma called us in for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners that I ever had with my grandparents, because all we did was eat, and laugh, and eat, and laugh, and eat a @CAPS3 more, and laugh a @CAPS3 more! Well @CAPS6 and I had a tradition that was started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats and watch @CAPS8's together. And from that night on to the day he died, my best friend was my @CAPS6. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since then. But when he passed he left me his truck. Every morning when I get in and start it up, the sound of the engine just brings back memories of him and I. The sound of the blinker even brings some memories too.  But I know that everyday he looks down on me and thinks back to all of the good times that we had. Ah, how I miss the good times.

 When people think of football they think of the quarter back. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big @NUM1 inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation.I have been pitching fast pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is "you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole time just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at who as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do.I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is @LOCATION1, they were first in state last year and were are very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing @NUM2. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it.

We all need laughter once in our life!, but why do we need it? or why is it important to us?. We need laughter to have a great time with our friends and family because with out laughter our life's would be black and white we would be empty from inside with no spark of happiness and we would be grumpy all the time. Laughter is also important to us because that also gets us as people be in a relationship with someone we really like it maybe a female or a male it's also important that in the relationship you also have a great time when you are with that special person and not be bored and talk about things that really don't matter when you are with that person. Its fun when you make someone laugh because that shows that @CAPS6 are having a great time with you and might want to hang out some other day again and that's why we need laughter in a relationship or in friendships. Once I use to live in @LOCATION3 till my parents decided to move to @PERSON2.@CAPS5 my parents told me I was going to go to @LOCATION1 I knew a few people from this @LOCATION1.The people I knew were @NUM1,and @PERSON1 but I didnt really talk with @LOCATION2 or @CAPS1 before I only talked with @PERSON1. On my first day of @LOCATION1 he presented @CAPS2 friends to me because I didn't really know anybody else besides them three he would make up any kind of jokes and would involve me in it so I would be able to meet this friends better and maybe be friends with them but laughter always make friends and boy friends because I started dating when I was in middle @LOCATION1 I dated three guys my third boyfriend was the best he was sweet and nice he would do @CAPS3 ever just to make me laugh we only dated for @NUM2 years but @CAPS5 there was too much drama that I broke up with him it was really hard because I really liked him but we would still talk and make fun of each other he would still be nice to me even if we were not together like he wanted and me to but just because of the drama we had we broke up.always laugh dont get down just because of a relationship smile and laugh.After a year with out dating he decided to ask me if I wanted to be @CAPS2 girlfriend again and I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama as before.While we were not dating he would always find away to make me laugh or smile. when he sees me down @CAPS2 always there for me to support me and make me laugh that's @CAPS3 I like about him that @CAPS2 sweet and nice but if he only didn't believe @CAPS3 @CAPS2 friends tell him we would still be together and we would be laughing at everything together. We would make fun of each other we would never stop laughing it was some great times when I was with him but he still try's to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad sad or not in the mood of doing something that's why we need laughter in our life's because it brings joy to does people that love us and care for us and by us having a smile in our face @CAPS6 are happy. Always make a relationship good by having a good time and making each other laugh one way or another it doesn't matter of @CAPS3 you laugh the thing is that you have fun.  Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and friends at the same time is to have a time and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go watch a movie or go to the fair were ever you think you want to go but also think about your friends and boyfriend if @CAPS6 are going to have fun there or if @CAPS6 will get bored. When you go with them make sure you make them laugh at least so @CAPS6 know that you are having fun make up a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @CAPS4 told us a joke it goes like this (guy on the @NUM3 I speak to your dad?" the little boy whisper and said "@CAPS2 busy!","@CAPS3 about your mom?" said the man on the phone, @CAPS5 the kid said "@CAPS4 is busy too!" @CAPS5 the man asked him "@CAPS5 @CAPS3 are @CAPS6 doing?" and the boy says"@CAPS6 are looking for me!" we didn't get it at first @CAPS5 my sister told us that the boy was hiding from @CAPS2 parents because he took the phone with him as in the boy don't tell jokes like does make it more funner. and thats why we need laughter in our life's.

 Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful.

 Can you imagine life without laughter? Life would be so serious, and relationships would be so boring. That favorite comedy? Not funny. America's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3's, how can you not laugh! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manor. What is it that relationships are built off of? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Do you really want to be around someone @CAPS4 is boring? Because I don't. I believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. Many of my relationships have begun from a joke, laughter, or me being clumsy. I remember being in a class where I knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. I sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was @PERSON1. It started off quite and no on saying anything, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. Seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breath, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? When this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From that point we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. The other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. I am an all around "laughter enthusiast!" I can make the smallest things funny, its a quality I enjoy very much @CAPS4 knew a silly joke could go so far? Laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone @CAPS4 you can laugh with, or be yourself with? It is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think that I could go a day without laughing. Laughing can be the antidote for a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!

 For my family laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents aren't fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of @DATE1. My parents had been fighting all day, for me it seemed like it would never end. Usually @DATE1 was what I looked forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents fight, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but whenever they started fighting around her, she started to scream and yell. When my parents fought I tried to keep my brother and sister busy but that never kept me busy. I still heard everything they said and it seemed to never stop.  My sister was about one year old and when my parents fought she came into my room a lot because it was the farthest room from where the yelling was going on. We would watch @CAPS1 and play games until it stopped. Once, it went on for so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There were so many times where I wished my parents would just stop fighting and realize that it not only makes them upset, it made all of us upset.  Well, the day before @DATE1 eve my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. Since my moms work doesn't allow kids to be there, my dad took us along. I could tell he had been up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and he had forgotten to shave that @TIME1. Since, we were all on break from school, my whole day was spent making sure my little sister didn't get into mischief or get hurt. I had fun at my dads work because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbled when she walked so it made me laugh when we would play tag because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom but she got herself into a lot more mischief now. On days when my dad didn't have much to do, he would have me help him try and teach my brother how to ride a two wheeler. It was a lot of fun seeing my brother try new things and have fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something that he couldn't do before.  When @DATE1 eve came my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on @DATE1 @TIME1. Except that night they had a really big fight after they thought all of us had gone to bed. I had stayed up that night really late cause I was watching a bunch of my favorite @CAPS2 movies. I had just turned the @CAPS1 off when I heard them yelling. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the yelling and screaming. Luckily, my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next @TIME1, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was how it normally was on @DATE1 @TIME1. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and said that everyone was out in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put my robe and my slippers on and went out to the living room. What I saw when I got out there was not at all what I had expected. My brother was sorting the presents so that everyone had their own pile. My dad was laughing at my sister, who was trying to pick up a presents that was as tall as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyones favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier then they had been the last few days.  As we all ate our breakfast and opened presents, I realized this was the first @TIME1 in a while that my parents haven't fought. It made me really happy to see them getting along. We all laughed and had a great time that @DATE1 @TIME1. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part in my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more moments of laughter and being happy then being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we are happy and laugh a lot more, being at home is alot better. I really do believe laughter plays a big part in any family.

Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today.   When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other.  As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends.  It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end.

 Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life.  I was about nine. The age @CAPS4 you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for @CAPS3 inside. "@CAPS1 on @CAPS2," she said. "We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours." I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned @CAPS3 out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked @CAPS3 up and tossed @CAPS3 in the car.  Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was clapped-out, so I felt it was alright to have a little "@CAPS3" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what your going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth-watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could @CAPS1 home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch-black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. "@CAPS4's @CAPS5?" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit @CAPS3 like a ton of bricks. "@CAPS5 passed away," my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @CAPS4 my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped @CAPS3 more than I could have ever anticipated.

The @CAPS1 of Laughter   The @CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. @PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The @CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The @CAPS2 began last @DATE1 during my @CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for @CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a @NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That @MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the @ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the @ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with @PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called @PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @PERSON1 to see were I was and of course @PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing @PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put @PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that @PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.

 Green is not my favorite colorLaughter is an indulging part of life that a variety of people @MONTH1 enjoy or @MONTH1 not enjoy. Humor happens to be infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared upon one another, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to pick out one of the million laughter memories I have had was nearly impossible for me to decide, because every moment I spend opening my mouth and bursting out my "ha-ha-ha" with joy and excitement. I try to indulge the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened.  It was the @DATE1, @CAPS1 for many of us @DATE1 is one of the most enthusiastic times of our twelve months in the year. I was going to be hosting a pool party with all of my friends, @CAPS12 I needed to clean it out because it happened to be awfully disgusting from all the year long seasons that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be that much of a deal because that was the only way I would be able to host my party with my parents permission. @CAPS1 if you know me well enough, I am the average typical teenage girl that probably texts more than @NUM1 texts a day. So since I can't keep my white, somewhat sweaty hands off my phone you @MONTH1 already have a feeling of what happens next. If you taught I dropped it. Your absolutely wrong. Not surprisingly after cleaning out my pool for about one hour I finally finished, @CAPS2 I texted my boyfriend telling him that my pool was no longer green anymore. He replied with ".......?" I questioned myself if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turns out that I had wrote to him, " @CAPS3 my poop is no longer green anymore." I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later that day. I decided to just pretend it didn't happen anymore. So later that day my pool party started. Everyone showed up and looked at me in a weird way then usual @CAPS12 I was to ecstatic and pumped to my favorite song by my favorite singer @NUM2. As everyone showed up they all had a present bag in there hand, I wondered to myself why they brought presents if it wasn't anybody's birthday it was just a casual pool party to welcome everyone's favorite season, @DATE1. So I asked the question to my best friend and she told me, "@CAPS4 we know its nobody's birthday @CAPS12 @CAPS5 texted all of us telling us you had green poop, and you were not feeling well so we went to @CAPS6 to buy you @CAPS7-@CAPS8, and @CAPS9 @CAPS10 ." I was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard. So I stood up in front of all my guest and told them what had really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception we kept the party going, and I eventually saw my boyfriend coming. I walked up to him and all we did was laugh with compassion and didn't mention one word about what had happened.   Once the party was over and it became dawn we decided to have a bonfire and get cozy with our loved one, and just all us friends bond with one another. You can guess what happened next, we began to talk about what had happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I have laughed that hard in my fifteen years alive. Rapidly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all my friends left and they made a nickname for me, "@CAPS11." @CAPS12 the funniest part about this story that I will never forget is, that when all my friends left, my boyfriend decided to take me out and get a burger at our local, also known as the best hamburgers in our town. As we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy. I had to take a few seconds out of my life to carry it, and make my dummy looking face in order to make it jiggle a bit. @CAPS12 little did I know that the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit gets all over me. I was honestly not mad, nor embarrassed. I just laughed so hard that I could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out. I believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever. It @MONTH1 be sad, embarrassing or even a comical quality type of moment we indulge in our memory. So till this day I am still known as "@CAPS11" to my friends, and there is no doubt that I will ever forget this memory.

 Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy.

 Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, "is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her "girl with purple hair", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through.

 Many people say that the people who laugh more live longer. I remember when I was ten years old, I was going to learn how to ride a bike. Little did I know it was going to be a hard task. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Although I was scared, looking at other kids ride their bikes made me gather up courage to learn how to ride a bike.  It was the big day, it was a perfect day to learn how to ride a bike. As I walked down the stairs all geared up and ready I began to feel @LOCATION1. I went outside, my big brother was waiting for me. He had a helmet and the bike, he began to go over the basic rules. Slowly I started to get on the bike, I was confident I could do it.  Next it was time to gear up and put my helmet on. My heart was pounding, I could feel my blood going through my veins. Giving the first peddle I fell and hit the ground extremely hard. All I wanted to do was run home and cry on my moms lap. I looked up at my brother, he asked me if I was okay. Up until this day I can remember laughing instead of crying, after all crying wasn't going to make the pain go away nor teach me how to ride a bike.  Finally, I got back on that bike and peddled and peddled. I can remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine around. I was laughing as a peddled, sometimes I think that maybe laughter is what made me accomplish my goal to learn how to ride a bike. in my life laughing and smiling and having fun is a big deal. You can't always take laugh too seriously.

 When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3.

 Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says "@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed "@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say "That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also.

     In order to to laugh you have to be happy. I was once happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I've made me more dissapointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful babygirl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has effected me and my family. Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS1 over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority and when i get out I gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now.   In the @DATE1 I would have never guessed that I'd be here where I'm at now but when I get home I'm gonna put a smile on my brothers face and my parents and when I see my girl I'm gonna go give her the biggest smoochie boo kiss of her life so she'll cry and laugh.

The @CAPS1-inspirational, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 I @CAPS5 the @CAPS6 of @CAPS7 -- @PERSON1. What is @CAPS13, exactly? Some might say, "@CAPS8, that's obvious. @CAPS13's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally-humorous, less-than-inspirational story about my experiences as a @CAPS9-@CAPS10-@CAPS11 basketball player.  This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which @CAPS13 took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the "sit-outs" zone in middle school @LOCATION1, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed "better than dirt" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as @CAPS13 was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action.  Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that.  @CAPS13 was one game in particular twhen I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. @CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about @NUM1 points against a team we had fared @CAPS8 against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, @PERSON2, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only made him embarrassed him more. Sitting beside @PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over number @NUM2, the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while @NUM2's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more @CAPS8 suited for covering @ORGANIZATION1 songs than calling out plays. I turned towards @PERSON2, tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and "don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-@CAPS12" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: "@CAPS12 always know @CAPS4 to make us laugh, @PERSON1". Suddenly @CAPS13 dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use @CAPS7 to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made @CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities.  And so @CAPS13 was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear -- replaced with optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger, to be the best they could be. So, @CAPS12 tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is @CAPS13 something more?  Spoiler alert: @CAPS13's much, much more.

 Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, "heck no!" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was "fun." I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, "@CAPS2're going to fall." All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, "I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it.

 Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem "creepy crawly." A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion.

 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was a warm @DATE1 @CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @CAPS3. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS2 all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS3. We all agreed that @CAPS4 was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS1. To start off, we all met @CAPS2 the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON3, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, @CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS6 @CAPS7 first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS4 was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS4. Unfortunately, @CAPS4 costed @MONEY1 that i did not have, so we left @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Next, we went to @NUM1 @CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON3 and I created a black teddy @PERSON1 with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS4 an awsome top hat and named @CAPS4 @CAPS11 @PERSON1. We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY2 for @CAPS4 and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS4 was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION1, left the @CAPS3, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS4 was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS4 up almost as tall as me before @CAPS4 toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS4 lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. @CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS4 didn't quite work. @PERSON4, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON4 had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS4 back to @PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. "I wanna go first!" screamed @PERSON3 as we all made @CAPS4 up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS4 was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS4. @PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and then @CAPS5. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS2 the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS4 was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS4 had turned out to be an even better @CAPS1 than we had expected. The whole @CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?

The time i went @CAPS1-wheeling!One time when i went @CAPS1-wheeling with @PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON1, @PERSON4 and i we went up @ORGANIZATION1. This is the arrangements of who was in what trucks. It was @PERSON2 and I in my @CAPS2 @NUM1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON4 in his tracker @NUM1, and @PERSON3 and @PERSON5 in his @NUM3 wheel drive jeep @CAPS3. When we started to head back down the mountain @PERSON3 let @PERSON5 drive down. @PERSON5 can't see very well at night because she wears glasses and her eye sights not very good. Well i was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the pavement and @PERSON5 was going pretty fast for that road because its a narrow curving road and that was the first time she had ever been on it before. She went to go around a really sharp corner and got up on two wheels and flipped over right in front of me so i had to slam on the brakes so that i wouldn't run into them. So i shut my truck off run over there as fast as i could and helped @PERSON5 out of the truck and when i turn back around to go help @PERSON3 out hes already on top of the truck.He looks at @PERSON5 ans says "@CAPS4 look at what you did to my truck, i have tried many of times to roll it and never have been able to god damn you!". So we all started laughing and then i got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over. Then it was really quite and @PERSON4 farted and we all started to laugh again. Well then @PERSON3 found out that he got a hole in his radiator i had to pull him back to his house and it seemed like the longest drive ever because his truck weighs way more than mine so i had to pull him home in @CAPS1 wheel drive and you cant go over thirty in @CAPS1 wheel drive because stuff can break. So we finally get to his house and his dad comes out side and he saw the truck and was really pissed because he gave that truck to him for a graduation present and he messed it all up. Then he finally cooled of cause he said no one was hurt and he was glad for that so we went in the house and ate dinner and went to bed. So the moral of the story is be very careful because things can happen when they are unexpected.

 We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh.

 Laughter is the most important part when you meet other people. Even a light smile can change the image of whole person. Sometimes, people practice their laughter to get better image of themselves. I believe that every people contain their own personality in their laughter. How you laugh is the way to express how you feel. For example, you can tell you are not comfortable by chuckling nervously, or you can tell it wasn't actually funny sarcastically by laughing without any tone or emotions like a robot. You can tell lots of things with a laughter. Usually, friendships are made automatically when two people have something in common and agree with each other. And a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else. As an @CAPS1, I had very hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter. As I know, many @CAPS2 people don't know that @CAPS1 can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very much developed. That's why other people think @CAPS4 are always angry and doesn't like humor. Thanks to that, I had lots of misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, I don't look like I'm laughing which makes an unnatural laughter. When I first got here, it was in middle of semester and I couldn't speak @CAPS5 as well as I do now. I had no friends at all. It was a really hard job becoming a friend of someone without knowing what they know, or what their sense of humor is. In @LOCATION1, I usually made friends by making them laugh, but in here, I didn't know how to make them laugh. I had to listen to them quietly what they were laughing about, and I had to figure out what kind of sense of humor they had. Finally, when I made one friend, I still couldn't laugh. I didn't understand any of words what they were talking about. I didn't know when to laugh and where to laugh. It seems quite silly when I look back then right now, but I was really serious. I really missed @LOCATION1 where I had friends I can understand and laugh together. Living without sense of humor made me very depressed. I suddenly stopped laughing at all because I thought laughing alone would look stupid. I kept searching about this country's culture, and I tried to watch television more to learn what they have in their heads. And then, I finally understood those slang words they used and I could laugh when other laughed. I was really happy. I was so happy that I could make other people laugh. I made lots of friends and I laughed with them. But I still couldn't understand some of the language or some other things they laugh about, but I just laughed when they laughed. It made me feel I was one of them when I laughed with them, and I was really happy about it. There was a research about laughter and life, and it said that you live longer when you laugh more. They say that even fake laughter can fool your brain and it can be healthy. Then I saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter. There are some groups of people who laugh together to be healthy. They gather around and starts laughing. It was really strange when I first saw that group on @CAPS6, but I saw people's effort to be healthy. I figured that fake laughter makes everyone happy, and laughter can cover every person's mistake. I also figured that there are still many ways to laugh in this world. By a small laughter, or even a fake laughter, we can make a better society and live a better life.

 Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say "@CAPS4 sad panda's today" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile.

 Laughter is used as a "cure" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist.

 An argument is defined as "A discussion in which disagreement is expressed." In many cases, a proverbial "@CAPS1" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS1, and provide a common ground in which problems @MONTH1 be solved.

                                        Laughter  @CAPS1 I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS3 odd it is, @CAPS3 much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS3 bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS3 weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS3 people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy.

 Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say "hi" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten.

 Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry.There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes @CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in the own way. The world never be as one, their will always be war all the time forever on earth.

 A time laughter has been in one of my relationships, was when I was down in the dumps and my cousin made me smile. It was a rainy @DATE1 @TIME1 and I just woke up, my dad had asked me to make him some of breakfast; while I was making the hash browns, eggs, and toast I thought of how little me and my dad spend together, and how unsteady and rocky our father-daughter relationship was and I thought of things we could do together. When I brought his breakfast up to him I proposed the idea of going to the movies, he said he would think about it and told me to go get started on my chores. When I was finally done I got on facebook and talked to my cousin @CAPS1; I told him how excited I was to go with my dad to the movies and how we were finally spending more time together.By the time it reached five o'clock in the afternoon, I went back upstairs to talk to my dad. I asked him what time we would be leaving, he said around eight and that is when I got the feeling we were not going to go after all. I walked out of his room and strolled down the stairs only to find myself swelling up with tears; I curled up in my @CAPS2-boy chair in the living room and waited for eight to be come. The time it came I was full of disappointment, and my father said we would go the next day but he was going to bring a friend. Because his friend was going to see his daughter (and also my friend since the age of three) at her gymnastics's meet, I didn't have a problem with seeing the meet or her. I did have a problem though with someone else coming with my dad and I to the movies. Though I wanted to spend quality time with him; it made me upset that my dad didn't want to spend quality time with me, we hardly even talked and that is hard to do when you live under the same roof.I went back down stairs and climbed back in my chair and cried, and decided that it must have been my fault,and that I did something wrong. So i got up and talked to someone I know could help me out of the dumps. He is one of the only people who I absolutely love talking to, and someone who knows me very well. It is my cousin, we have a very strong relationship that has almost nothing but laughter in it. At first he tried reassuring me but it didn't work, so he did something he knows best he made me laugh by doing or saying silly random things; he even said he would eat my poor little kitty if I didn't smile for him. That is when I started giggling and he kept going to keep me laughing, until the only tears I was crying from trying to breathe. He always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down. And I can do the same for him, he @MONTH1 be my cousin but he's also my best friend and that makes me feel the love I need from my family that only he can give me, and I hope I will never ever forget or lose that with him.Before I became friends with @CAPS1 I never thought I could have someone I could really talk to about my home life. He understands me and what I've been through and knows me as well as I know him and I enjoy that. I could have never have asked for anything better. He's my favorite cousin and the best out of my best friends, who loves talking to me and making me laugh until I'm trying to breathe for air. I will never forget what he's done for me, but this stands out more then every other time and I thank him for that. That is how and why laughter has and is a important part in all and in every relationship to and for everyone.

 A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a @ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.

One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs "bro bro"! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering "its ok". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories.

@DATE1 what a night!! Me and my friends we were going to a @CAPS1 party at our dance coaches work. we had to dress up as elves and play with kids. It was fun, but after we were done with the party that's when the real fun began! After we changed out of our costumes and back into our regular clothes we started taking pictures. @CAPS3 were funny ones,cute one, and weird ones,all kinds of pictures. Anyways my friends and i didn't want to go home just yet so we decided that we should go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun! First stop was a school play ground but we couldn't stay because it was late and we weren't allowed inside so we decided to go to the discovery park i was driving and one of my friends in the passenger seat was taking pictures that turned out really funny. so when we got to the park my friend that was taking the pictures said  @CAPS2 i drive around the parking lot?" I said sure. we switched spots and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but @CAPS3 was some scary moments that i felt we were going to die. ha ha. So she drove around and then went to the stop sign by a main road where she decided it would be a good time to switch back and i was yelling at her "@CAPS3's a car coming we @CAPS2 get in trouble", but no she didn't listen to me she got out so then i had to get out and we were yelling at each other and my friends in the back seat were yelling also not because we were mad but we didn't want to get caught and we were having a lot of fun. so i get back in the driver seat and we are all yelling " get in the car" but she laughing really hard saying " I wet my pants." we all started laughing because we thought she was kidding but oh no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So i had to back up the car so she could change behind this big metal thing. As she was changing we thought it would be really funny if we got a picture of her changing so i got the camera and stuck it out the window, but it was really dark even with the flash on so the picture didn't come out! she was laughing so hard that we teased her saying " keep it in". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. When ever we are laughing really hard and someone says " oh i think I'm gonna pee my pants" we look at @PERSON1 and say " @PERSON1 knows what that's like" we have too much fun teasing her about things she's done.  the next day we go and tell the rest of our friends that weren't with us what happened and they all started laughing as hard as we did. At the time she wasn't in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends, but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing. now everyone knows about that night and @PERSON1's " accident". every now and then we make fun of her but she laughs along because we all know it could have been anyone of us. It still makes me laugh today not as much as it did back when it really happened, but you @CAPS2 still get a laugh on it every now and then."

 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  For me laughter is a huge part of life. I cannot, nor wish to escape it. @CAPS1 is fun in itself. It always makes tense situations become relaxed and enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter. @CAPS1 is the best way to unite people together and form memories and bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that cause the potential, and often result, of laughter. It is the same way with my distant families such as my friends at school. Life growing up with a brother, wonderfully fun neighbors, and cousins have produced most of my @CAPS1 memories. One such time, in which laughter flowed freely, happened rather recently. The situation began when my brother, @PERSON1, had to do a school assignment. @PERSON1 was assigned, by his history teacher, to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the @DATE1's. I did not set out to help him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was thoroughly glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun. I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I came into @PERSON1's room and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas. We were making progress and once reaching a certain point, we both contributed to a subtle humorous comment we decided to add to the entry. Reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. The noise poured out of @PERSON1's room like lava from a volcano! My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but to us it was hilarious. Being in a good mood, and considering @PERSON1's history teacher said to make the entries creative, more humorous and quite witty sentences were added. By this time I was doubled over struggling to speak through all the @CAPS1 I was consumed by. @PERSON1 was hardly better. Homework had @CAPS3 been more fun. We finished quicker than if @PERSON1 was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling. @PERSON1 ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher.  This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter @CAPS4 the moment. This particular instance helped with work and yet @CAPS4 the work not a chore, but rather a tremendously happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production. All things considered, laughter, in my opinion, makes for the greatest @CAPS2.

 I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.  The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends,family,or a significant other.

            Just One @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the @DATE1 of us, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1 and I, walk under the cover of the trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a chat. @LOCATION1, who is six foot @DATE1, has long raven-black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, plopped down in the wet green grass. But @PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about @DATE1 paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. @PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON2's feeling that way made @LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS5 teletubies, went to @PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about @DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking @CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS6-@CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS6-@CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and @PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine.

 Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 "@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's." @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, "I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice." I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS4 know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS4 help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on.

            "Laughter" @CAPS1 you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you @CAPS11 never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it @CAPS11 make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and @CAPS11 always put a smile on our face when we @CAPS2 down.It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will causes you to be come one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of @CAPS7 life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever.  @DATE1 was the day i met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by @CAPS7 amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to @CAPS1 some fun. We quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS7 soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS4 had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS7 eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS7 eyes, it wasn't @CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS7 high school. @CAPS3 leans down and ask me, "@CAPS2 you okay?" I reply in a shy tone,"yes..." @CAPS3 smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS7 body. I look at him and @CAPS11 tell @CAPS3 was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS7 feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits @CAPS7 mouth is, "@CAPS4 is your name?"@CAPS3 reply's with a smile and says, " @CAPS6 and you?""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8." I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS3 would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS3 reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS7 spine. @CAPS3 says "I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?"A huge smile washes over @CAPS7 face as i say "yes." @CAPS3 grabs @CAPS7 hand and walks me closer to @CAPS7 friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS7 house. @CAPS3 smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is. The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS7 head was, I cant believe @CAPS3 wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION1. When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. "@CAPS11 i kiss you?" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH1 @CAPS3 rest in peace...

Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage "drama" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said "@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your "drama" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her."@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told "@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing." @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said "like all great things" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.

In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,"what you are saying is funny" or, I'm enjoying this". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right.

             The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter can be used in many different ways, you could either laugh because something is funny, to be rude, or just because you enjoy what people are doing and @CAPS3 brings a smile to your face. Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because @CAPS3 could hurt them even more then we imagine, and @CAPS3 could even affect their life @CAPS2 they grow older. When I was younger I faced a situation which affected me @CAPS2 I grew up. I have always enjoyed singing ever since I could remember, but up to one point I couldn't bare to sing in front of a crowd or even my family.  I was about four years old. @CAPS3 was a dark @DATE1 @TIME1, my family decided that we were going to go out to have some fun at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. This @ORGANIZATION1 was where family and friends could get together to have a great time, there would be a band playing, bright round colorful tables to sit at, drinks, and @CAPS3 had a game room for the children to play at. My cousin's and their band were going to playing that @TIME1. My family and I got all dressed up, I wore a beautiful white dress that my mother had chose for me to wear. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived my family and I sat at a bright, lime green, glow in the dark, round table and watched the performance.  I danced with my parents for a long time and then I would play games with my brother and friends. My cousin who is the lead singer of the band was calling out in the microphone if anyone would like to sing a @CAPS1 to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them that this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do @CAPS3. They smiled at me and said "yes sweetheart, of course you can do @CAPS3!" @CAPS2 I ran up to where my cousin was standing, I pushed through the bundle of children so that I could be in the front. I looked up smiled, and raised my hand at my cousin shouting for her to chose me. My cousin smiled back and picked me up and placed me on the speaker! I was so delighted, I couldn't even breath. @CAPS3 was my biggest dream to stand up here with a microphone in my hand. @CAPS2 I stood on the big speaker box, I looked at the crowd of people and took a deep breath and I began to sing. I was singing my most favorite @CAPS1 that I knew by memory. The crowd smiled and clapped, but @CAPS2 soon @CAPS2 I sang the chorus of the @CAPS1 everyone started to laugh. I didn't know why they were laughing. Was @CAPS3 because I accidentally forgot to take my gum out of my mouth? Because I did happen to forget. Or was @CAPS3 because I sounded really bad? I was so scared, the gum that I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice grew faint. I began to panic, my eyes started to become watery. I noticed tears coming down all over my face. I couldn't even bare being up in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mother, and began to cry in her lap. I cried for a long hour, my family tried telling me that everything was fine and that I did a magnificent job, but @CAPS3 wasn't enough for me to believe @CAPS3. Over the years I always detested singing in front of people. @CAPS3 scared me just having the thought of maybe someone would burst out laughing because I was either bad, or off key. After that I always began to tell myself that I had a horrible voice and I knew @CAPS3 was the reason why the crowd at the @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at me. Every time my parents would ask me to sing a @CAPS1 I would tell them "no thank you, I don't like to sing anymore." @CAPS3 wasn't true at all, I lied about @CAPS3 to my own parents, but I still had that horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I am older I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason why the people laughed wasn't at all what I thought @CAPS3 was. My parents told me that @CAPS3 was because the people thought that I was adorable, and since I was young I couldn't really pronounce some words right. I giggled at @CAPS3, and now I just keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I am trying to stay positive about @CAPS3. @CAPS3's still very hard for me to sing a solo, but after a certain period of time I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone.

 I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the @LOCATION2 all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to @LOCATION1 that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1 and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; @CAPS1 place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be @LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, "dad what is that"? and he says "that is a falling star" i was like "in the middle of the day"? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh.
<START>

 There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into a serious and none joking around madder. It all started on a @DATE1 @TIME1, my brother @ORGANIZATION1 called me and told me to come come over I hadn't been over at my moms house in a while. I replied yeah sure man ill be over in a hour. I jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house.While on the way I stopped to get some gas at the gas station. Fifteenth minutes later I arrived at my moms house. once arrived my brother was out side waiting for me. @ORGANIZATION1 came up to the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once I was in the house I walked over to the kitchen saw my @CAPS1, and gave her a hug, and asked her how she was doing? She replied, I'm alright hunny, then asked me what was new, with myself? I said nothing much @CAPS1, hanging out trying to stay out of trouble. I asked her is there anything she needed me to do? Or needs to be done? My om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house. After she was done telling me some of the things i headed to my room to change into my work cloths, then headed out side. I grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out. While we were down at the garage @ORGANIZATION1 brings up the fact that I haven't been there in a while he said party tonight. I replied ok. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needs to be fixed, so we moved the tractor over and fixed the fence. Its was @NUM1 at night already people were already showing up.  When we got to the house my @CAPS1 comes out and says, what you guys doing out here? Get in the party already, it's a full house there were @NUM2 people in my moms house that night. Drinking and just having a good time. When i walked up to the living room i noticed the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games. There were a couple games going on, for example there was beer pong, shots, and beer bong. There was always someone that wanted to beat the drinking record in the house, to be the best drinker. The drinking record in the house for one night of drinking was @NUM3 shots and @NUM4 beers. To this day the record still stands and the person who holds the record is me. I look over at shots and a friend of my @CAPS1 said i wanna challenge you. I said ok. It did not end up well @NUM5 shots, and the guy that was against me was passed out on the table.  Hours later everyone was sleeping but me, my brother and one of our friends. We were out side chewing while @ORGANIZATION1 was peeing on his dads car. All of the sudden I look over and @ORGANIZATION1 is puking all over on the ground. I laughed so hard i feel over because the look on his face while smiling when he was throwing up. My friend @PERSON1 and I took @ORGANIZATION1 down stairs to his bed put him to sleep and went back up stairs, to lay down. Before we when it the door opened and it's @ORGANIZATION1 he wanted to say he loves us and good night. We replied thanks bro same to you. Less that thirty seconds later We heard oh crap and a loud noise falling down the stairs, it was @ORGANIZATION1. The next @TIME1 I woke up and I did not feel so good, I told my @CAPS1 about it. She said ok well ill make you some food. So she did I did not feel better so I just went home to sleep. I opened my door I saw my @CAPS1 at my house and said, @TIME1 @CAPS1. She replied you drank? I said yes, and i don't feel so good. she said ok well ill take you to the doctor if it does not get better. A month went by of me not eating right or drinking, so i went to the doctor and they told me i messed up my liver so bad I had the liver of a @NUM6 year old, all i remember was crying and saying to my @CAPS1 never again. I realized drinking and having fun is all ok until someone gets hurt. The doctor told me if i was to drink again I could die, I made the best choice of my life there i believe. To this day I have not drank any alcohol at all it has been a year and @NUM7 days. Laughing and having a good time is great but there are always some thing that go wrong, @CAPS2 under age drinking is aloud at my moms house now.

@NUM1)I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. he wasn't that high levelin his company. @CAPS2 he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh.One day, the boss of company came to his company and asked everyone  who doingwork hardest?" @CAPS2 nobody didn't answer that question. then the boss said "or recommendsomeone for promote level" and then everyone recommended that business man. Becausehe always say hello to everyone with big laugh. and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss. what I'm trying to say is the laugh make people happier. and when i was with my friends,laugh was make us more friendly. also laugh is good for health too. If you laugh a lotyour life is getting way more longer than before. of course it is good for mind too.that business man wasn't very good worker. He just made everyone happier to his laugh.that's why he could be a highest level of the company.I think laugh is really good for everything. and I also laugh a lot. I want people make happier."

 Laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2                         @CAPS3 @CAPS4 someone who laughs a lot or a little? If @CAPS4 @CAPS3 the kind of person that can laugh about any and everything, then I'm sure we would get along well. Laughter plays a key part in my life. @CAPS1 is a part in about three different ways, in that I joke around a lot about numerous things, I do funny things such as make funny faces, and last I also laugh about me being a klutz. When @CAPS4 see me or talk to me for either a short amount of time or an abundant amount of time I guarantee I can and will make @CAPS4 laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing, when in any kind of situation as in an awkward one, an embarrassing time, or just any kind of situation when @CAPS4 don't know what @CAPS4 should do; just remember @CAPS4 can laugh in those times. Ever since I was just a young girl no matter where or what I was doing I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, " @CAPS4 @CAPS3 worse then a bull in a @LOCATION1 shop." @CAPS5 was so right. If @CAPS1 was just as simple as me dropping things, maybe even breaking glass, or falling; that statement was always true. All @CAPS5 could ever do when I did do something like that was just laugh, because @CAPS5 knew that @CAPS5 has a clumsy daughter.  Such as this one time when I was in elementary school, we had award assemblies every month, these were to recognize students who had been doing well that month and was following the rules of a certain characteristic. This was the day I had hoped for; my name to get called. When the teachers were up on the stage calling names, I was anticipating for @CAPS1 to be my turn. Then next up my name was called. I got up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and get my award. When I had gotten up there I got my award then went back down the stairs. Not a great idea when I was so excited. When I was going down, I literally went down the stairs. My feet had missed a stair, and I went flying down on my behind. Now tell me what would @CAPS4 do in this situation? In front of over two-hundred kids and about thirty parents? Well I just had to laugh @CAPS1 @CAPS2, get up, and go back to my seat. Another thing about laughter @CAPS1 really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would be doing if @CAPS1 weren't for me lacking dexterity when I was younger. Laughter has brought me closer to my family and friends. They know when I am looking gloomy; that if they want me to not look so gloomy that they will have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke around and laugh about numerous things. Sometimes @CAPS1 might be facetious, so we have to catch ourselves on those ones. From my experience of being clumsy no matter the situation, I learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again, that making @CAPS1 funny, and something @CAPS4 can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, @CAPS1 really has made me a better person; in that people know me me for many different things, but one of them is that I am a happy and funny girl and laugh a lot.That is something that I am proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have good time. So therefore laughter is not just one element or part in my life, @CAPS1 plays a huge part.

 It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry.
<START>

All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good bestfriends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup.

Laughing is something that everyone experiences. It changes situations from bad to funny. It's like magic. I mean you don't need a wand or anything, just a twisted sense of humor. You just need a little common sense and a little bit of illogical thinking. I know that those are two entirely different things but isn't that what makes us @CAPS4? isn't laughter just the response to hearing something illogical that differs from your common sense? No. It's not. Laughter is also an extremely helpful tool. you can do a lot of things with laughter. you can get out of trouble, get into trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, get a job, lose a job, win a game and, lose a game. and that's not everything, mind you. But I'm not here to talk about all of those things, just one of them. making friends with laughter. just sit back and listen and maybe you'll learn something.Before we begin the story, let me just start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and i know this, but I'm good at making people @CAPS4. It's not even on purpose half of the time. the majority of my jokes and humor consists of depressing things. I honestly think that I get that response from people because they don't know how else to react. And this is why @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway lets get back on track. Once upon a time where teens were desensitized to the harsh reality of modern living there was a kid. that kids name was @PERSON1. now I really hadn't known @PERSON1 for very long and, to be quite honest, i didn't really want to but he tagged along with me and grant and @PERSON3 back in the day. he always wore these awesome iron maiden t-shirts and listened to the type of music that i liked so i guess you could say it was fated but that's neither here nor there. One day we got to talking. We were both thinking about this big barrel that had been left in the track at our school. it was empty and plastic and when you're @NUM1 everything big and red and plastic looks fun. we decided that we would take the barrel and stand on it. Yes that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. no, the only upstanding conclusion we could come to was to stand on it. and we did. and it was fun.  the next day we came to school and @PERSON1 was handing out invitations to his birthday party. i was pretty excited so i went. as it turns out, our lives are very very much alike. i think the first thing i noticed when i went to his house was the kitchen. it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there. honestly i thought i was the only kid who lived the way i did. i used to get mad because my mom wouldn't ever buy matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and such in his house. collectible versions of different pint glasses, mismatched silverware, logical dish placement. i know it sounds stupid but it used to make me happy.  When the other guys arrived we started to talk, or at least i did. we talked about some random stuff too like @CAPS3 videos and good movies we had seen recently. @PERSON1 and i always ended up talking about other stuff like travel and the future and dogs but that's just because we agreed that newer movies kind of sucked, too many explosions and not enough character development. eventually we started a fire and moved our conversations outside. see, it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire. and when the fire goes out, you want that feeling again. well i was prepared to fix it but everybody went inside except me and @PERSON2 (another guy at the party) so we decided to play around a bit. we went into @PERSON1 garage and found his @NUM2 and brake fluid. we sprayed it on the fire and i think my face got a little sunburned after that. The flames had gotten so close to my face that i could feel my eyelashes burning on the tips. Then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire. everybody came back outside to play around with it. i know I'm kind of a bad influence but when life gives you an opportunity to do something fun, you can't pass it up. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and cracking jokes. I just wish we had a @CAPS4-@CAPS5-@CAPS6. That night, i made some eternal friends.

 Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw "That @CAPS3" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time.

I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the "@CAPS3" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. @CAPS6 i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS7 wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS13 i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS6 your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS13 i didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS8 was so anxious to see what @CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS7 out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS7 the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS7. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS13 nervous @TIME1 the same time to see what @CAPS7 would be like. Finally the day was here, honey wake up time for @CAPS5 mom said already @CAPS13... oh forget @CAPS7 i said im groin to @CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed brush my teeth, hair, do my make up and get dressed. "@CAPS9" "@CAPS9" @PERSON2 is here time to go. I rush down stares get my back pack and get in the car. @CAPS11 morning he said @CAPS11 morning, you excited for @CAPS5 he asked yeah kinda just a little nervous.Don t be i will introduce you to my girlfriend she is a fresh man also k sounds @CAPS11 i said. We pull into the @CAPS5 wow that's a a lot of kids i said yea there is @NUM2 freshman this year. We get out of the car and go inside. Lets go show you around to your classes alright i said. This is you first period @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in @CAPS8 staring @TIME1 me, my sstomach turning into notes wanting to fall out of my stomach. Welcome @LOCATION1 just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says. She shows me where to sit ans introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, @CAPS13 i still have to go to six more. This day feels like its going bye for ever, i walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary @CAPS13 no i was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce my self in the front of the class @CAPS7 was terrifying! I get on the bus can't wait to get @CAPS2. I walk threw the doors, how was your day, did you make friends, mom calm down i said to her sorry i just want to know. My day was @CAPS11, can i go take a shower now? Yeah just don't take long k.

  When we all get together on my dad side, we just all sit, laugh, and talk loud. I all ways say that we are one big fake @CAPS1 family. All the aunts, uncles, and cousin come around my grandma's small kitchen table and talk. There is so many conversation going on and people talking loud and laughing, that to me it make feel like a home away from home. This was the case when some of us got together for a late birthday party for me, when I was in @LOCATION1 @DATE2.   It was @DATE1, my grandma, uncle, aunt, dad, my two cousin, and I; were sitting around the kitchen table eating cake and talking. We were talking about a problem that I was having. Some how my dad deiced to pretend like we were in court. My aunt said to @PERSON2 to go and get a wig for the judge, which was my uncle. @PERSON2 brought back this blond wig and she puts it on my dad's head, he looked so funny. Aunt @PERSON3 was fixing the front of the wig for him. I grab his phone and start taking a bunch of pictures of him in the wig. I send one to my mom saying, "@CAPS2 mom dad is pretty." We were all laughing so hard. Then my grandma deices to put on the wig. Grandma keep saying that it was itchy and tickling her. After she took off the wig, she stared to tell us a story about the time when my grandpa pocked her in the left side of her rump with a compass. She first set up the story for us, by telling us who the teacher was. It was a funny @DATE2 name that I don't remember. Uncle @CAPS3 was doing an impression of what he thought the teacher would be like. His impression was like the old bank owner on @PERSON1. We all stared to laugh really hard. When my grandma finally got to the main part of the story, he was so mad at her, because she wrote his name down for talking in class and he also liked her. So he took a compass and poked her in the rump. For some reason my dad and uncle thought it was so funny that they made her say it over and over again in a rime. She couldn't say rump with out laughing. We all stared to laugh really hard because she couldn't say rump. Grandma was laughing so hard she would fall back into her chair and I though she was going to die of over laughter. The laughing got so bad we were starting to cry of laughing so much.  As you can see, my dad side really like to laugh and be funny.We are a great big fake @CAPS1 family. I believe that laughter is a very important part in any relationship you have with any one you meet. One of my favorite things to do is laugh and I will most likely laugh at anything some one says. When my dad and his younger brother get together prepare to laugh really, really hard.

 Do you remember the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle school jidders and everything is just happening to fast, I remember all that. I went to school at @CAPS1 for my middle school years, my teacher was @PERSON3. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably sit you by them thinking that you two would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @CAPS2, we were of course hoping that we would be seated next to each other. After we finally got our seating arrangements, we were not seated together. I was sat next to @PERSON4-- a girl that I didn't know at all-- @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON4, who I have never saw before in my life. As class went on @PERSON6 talked about middle school and how it is so important to get good grades and be prepared for high school, we all sat there and as to what it looked liked day dreamed. No one really talked to anyone, there was still that awkward first day thing going on. @PERSON4 looked like a girl that would rip your head off if you said anything to her, so I kept my mouth shut.  @PERSON6 went on with her "first day lecture" and all of a sudden she cracked a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started laughing. I would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker. After everyone after everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone loosened up a bit. @PERSON4 and I started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid. From then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @PERSON4 and I became partners for every project that we did and we were always together, she became my best friend after @NUM2 days; all because of laughter. I would have to say that the reason @PERSON4 and I became friends is because of laughter. I probably never would have talked to her in the first place; even though I am glad I did because now I have an awesome best friend! Middle school can be scary, excpecially on the first day of school. That's why I think laughter is such an important part in someones relationship, you can't get by without it!

One time I was sick, and I told my mom "I need to get some ice tea" so I get up and go to the freezer. Suddenly my throat gets irritated and I feel the need to cough, so I do and instead of coughing on the side I do it right into the ice bucket. And it just so happens that my mom was standing next to me, and she says "@CAPS1 god! son what was that?" so we started laughing. It was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the ice box it was funny I was keeping my germs alive and my mom used that ice.

It was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 when I decided to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with my friends @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @PERSON1, @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. We had a ride to @LOCATION1 and back so we rode along with @CAPS4's dad, on the way we listened to some A @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 (which i recommend to any @CAPS12 fans) once we got there i told a joke and we all laughed so hard they all pooped themselves and died.

 I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  "@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..." "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. "@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.." I slow down dramatically, "ONE!" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot "@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. "@CAPS6, look through." @PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  "@CAPS11!" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. "@CAPS12 did they all go?" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones "I love you". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.

 Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down.

  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter.

Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said "I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left." @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, "@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out." One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, "@CAPS3 think this is funny?" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, " @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?" "@CAPS6", @CAPS1 said, "@CAPS7?" I looked at him and said, "@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked." @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day.

Like when someone's upset, @CAPS2 just a have a good laugh and make yourself feel better. Ok I know I crack a few jokes here and there, @CAPS2 what i like to laugh alot it feels good, it makes me happy, and other people happy. I'm in foster care and i can't get out @CAPS2 laughter is an important part to my life at the moment. Even if I'm down it makes me happy to hear some one else having a good time.I miss hearing my parents laugh.My mom was an amazing mother, she had a funny laugh that would get me to grine, smile and just bust out laughing. We always had a good time, I remember when my mom took her meds @TIME1 and the pills make her a little hiper. @CAPS2 my own mother wanted to box me.@CAPS2 i had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, @CAPS3 my mom knew how to fight and every thing. @CAPS2 that experionce was a little scary. Ok enough @CAPS5 my mom, @CAPS4 my dad he was an exepttional man and father.He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us tp have himself a laugh.My father would go roller blading with us and try and trip us but he couldnt always keep up and if you got going to fast his legs would wobble and he would fall and me and my friends would just laugh.Every my parents past me and my family has been seperated and it sucks but laughter to me is there world right @CAPS4. I could have been my fathers twin, think hard @CAPS5 that.What Laughter Is All @CAPS5 ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''. And ''I @CAPS6 Believe Laughter Between Two Or @CAPS7 People Is An Important Part Of Any @CAPS8 Of @CAPS9.''

 My grandfather always used to say, "life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it @MONTH1 seem like it is changing, @CAPS1 really it's just repeating itself." @CAPS1 i have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned.  When i was twelve me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. i was put here in @LOCATION2 while they remained in @LOCATION1, where i was born. At first the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. it was like i had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually though time passed and the agony lessened @CAPS2 grip on our lives. It @MONTH1 seem cruel @CAPS1 most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. maybe @CAPS2 true what they say, "out of sight, out of mind."  @CAPS2 sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. we did everything together. we are very close in age, the youngest and I are only @NUM1 years apart. i remember all the times we would spend outside on humid @DATE1 days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, i was happy. If i think really hard I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only i could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe i could feel that happy content feeling once again.   Although much time has passed since our separation i still have those days when i feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. i can feel the three thousand mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though i am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do i bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then i hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling i needed all of a sudden, i am happy. With every small giggle my smile grows because i know i have made them feel whole again and for a second i have let them forget about for far i really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter i know that we are close again that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes i will always have that feeling of total bliss when i hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters.

 I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. "@CAPS1 game is everything we have worked for- every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS7 we lose tonight, everything we have worked was for nothing." I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS1 brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups.  The twenty minutes we had for warm ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS7 everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent.  The first two quarters ended with a dead even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE2 time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 opportunity to @CAPS2 around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My @CAPS3 opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clip board. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosised into a stomach thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS3's explanation in anticipation.  "@CAPS2 at yourself!" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ordered. "@CAPS5 are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON2 out to my first dance!" We could always rely on @CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS7 it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. "@CAPS7 @CAPS5 guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS5, @CAPS1 game would be a blow out! Instead, @CAPS5 are playing like a bunch of bunny foo-foos!" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had hear so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. To think that @CAPS1 confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable.  The whistle blew to start the @DATE2. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 @CAPS5 were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE1, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up everything that shouldn't effect @CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 forget the main purpose of why @CAPS5 play the game. Occasionally we need reminders, like the calming laugh of @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Without that reassuring laugh, my team never would have united, and defeated our opponent.

Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, "The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad." @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, "@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent." @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says "@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face." @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol.

Many people @MONTH1 think that laughter is not a big part of a relationship. i truly think that have a good laugh with your spouse is a good thing because it means that you are having a good time with each other. I will tell you a true story when i and my girlfriend were laughing and having a good time, and i will talk about another time when laughter was a big part in my life. In the next @NUM1 paragraphs i will decide how laughter help @CAPS1 out a lot in my life. laughter is all about having fun and it should be meant to hurt someone or make them upset or mad at you. I think some people really mean to hurt people because they don't care what they say to others and that's why laughter sometimes can hurt people. I have said some things to people that i thought were funny but the person i was saying it to didn't think it was funny. This first story I'm going to tell you is about @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. I have been dating @PERSON2 for about a month now and laughter is a big part in our relationship. @PERSON2 and i like to tell jokes to each other and make each other laugh and smile. If we didn't laugh and have a good time with each other than were would this relationship go. It wouldn't go the way i would want it t go. So i try everyday to make her laugh and smile at some of the things that i say because its a important thing in life to @CAPS1 anyways. @PERSON2 makes @CAPS1 laugh all the time and i think thats a good thing to her because she can be a very funny person all the time. So as long relationships have some laughter in it most of them will go for a while. The one person i think that has made @CAPS1 laugh the most is probably my dad. My dad every day when he comes to pick @CAPS1 up he always has something funny to say. I don't think he has not said something funny one day for a long time. The times when my dad is having a bad day at work and then when he comes home and is still in a bad mood i try to say something funny to get him out of his bad mood, and if that doesn't work i just go to my room to get away from him. But most of the time my dad comes home in a good mood because his job is very easy and he likes the people that he works with. Now that would have been a different story if we still lived in I'm @ORGANIZATION1. When we lived in @ORGANIZATION1 my dad had to commute back and forth to work from @LOCATION2 to @ORGANIZATION1. That was about a hour drive one way, so it put him not in a very good mood.but i didn't get to really see him much when we lived over in the @LOCATION4. so anything that funny i think i always try to say just to keep the laughter going.I believe that laughter is a big part in having friends. most friends like to joke around and laugh at things that are funny to them. so when you have a friend that likes to smile or likes to tell jokes usually they become friends and that person gets more friends and they whole community starts to like him in-till he says something that makes a lot of people mad. At our baseball practices @CAPS1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @CAPS2 we like to tell jokes jokes or say something that will make the whole team laugh. another person that is funny to @CAPS1 is @LOCATION3. @LOCATION3 tells a lot of jokes and has funny face exasperation, and the last person that is funny to @CAPS1 is @PERSON1 is one of those guys that thinks he inst funny but really is. I think i have a good friend relationship with all those people.I just told you why i think a good laugh is a good thing in a relationship. It is good around your parents so you can have a good relationship with them. I hope you liked my story. I enjoyed writing on this topic because it explains about @CAPS1 and it explains what i do with my spouse and my friends. I think that everybody has laughter in there life day in and day out to keep a good attitude wit people.

 When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleas-er. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of loosing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my @CAPS1 count, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Anything from rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry which students thought was funny, and occasionally destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me. As I advanced into high school I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately loose my funny, humorous personality. I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a father level of being unhappy. That so called "@CAPS1" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someones @CAPS1 who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her, it was just to hard for me. When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing!

  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.

 Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have gave my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It maybe be hard to not be an effect of the worlds chaos and daily epidemic but doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen just to be care free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.   My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position . I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heal shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possible hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a pick-nick under my favorite long green haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It's a fragile youth of a child. As life goes on my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in sol om. I had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times. I felt god had betray me if not hated me. I then had became a stone cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror I no longer seen a @CAPS3 for life just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect. If couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world? To @CAPS3, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself I learned the most important lesson; laughter and wiliness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said ,"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that take pride in everyday. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows I still manage to scrap up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand this is passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, their is always a rock awaiting to crumb to bring light. To me their is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that re-leaving feeling that everything will be all right. so I live me life through a gracious smile. In my perspective if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto," @CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on."

Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that "things were going to be okay". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that "laughter is the best medicine". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that "sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends.

     Every one laughs, i love to laugh in fact that's one of my favorite things to do. If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin @CAPS1 is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced m self but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the @LOCATION1 war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)

 Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. "@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. "@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?" I replied "@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. "@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask." I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. "@CAPS1 is going on in here?" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. "@CAPS8 dad." We said still laughing. "@CAPS9 then." @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. "@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, "@CAPS12 on my finger!" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. "@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!" I said in a loud voice. "I think it looks very nice." @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life.

   Laughter "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."-unknown. This quote has a lot of meaning to a lot of of people. I am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning. The best true story that I could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and I.   When I was little and still living with my dad, my mom fought with my dad all the time and neither one of them where ever happy. My dad and mom both had good jobs but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and got them both into dept. My dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the dept. My parents got divorced wich was a good thing for us all. I got to hang out with my dad and I found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be. My dad and I started going hunting and all sorts of stuff like that. I found that my mom is even worse when she is happy because she gets vary hyper and loud, or you could just say annoying. She gets me to laugh every once and a while but its always at her rather than with her.  I love being with my dad because I always have fun and learn something that will be vary helpful to me.  I think that laughter is important to have in any kind of friendship. If you pay attention to how you are around the people you like the most you will see that most of what you do is make each other laugh.

A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself "@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it," but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. "@CAPS9." @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said "@CAPS8.J looks like my alien," @CAPS18 said "wow that's rude." I said "In my eyes that's the perfect body." We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me "hang on, you'll make it;" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said " @PERSON4 answer the phone!" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said " oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said "stop messing around, now lets get back to work!" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to "quotidian teens." I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said "hello." (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said " hello @PERSON3, good luck in track." @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said "@CAPS16, you talked to your husband." We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said "jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down," or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said "come take my hand, we'll walk this road together."

 On a hot @DATE3 day during the middle of @DATE1 and I were having a blast camping in @LOCATION2. @PERSON1 and her family took me along on their camping trip we stayed in their @CAPS1, our campsite was right by the ocean so we would go on daily walks there. We stayed in @LOCATION2 for a week. During that week, i believe on @DATE2 her older sister went into labor she lives in @LOCATION1 which is a pretty long drive from @LOCATION2. That morning @PERSON1's mom and dad woke us up very early in the morning around six thirty A.M, @PERSON1 and i had stayed up @TIME1 before until about three thirty in the morning so we were pretty tired at that point. We found out that we were going to take a little plane from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4 airport and we got it fairly cheap because @PERSON1's brother works there. Sense we knew we had a long day ahead of us on only about three hours of sleep we both drank very strong coffee to keep us going. Then we were off to the airport the whole way there we were laughing about everything street signs, names of buildings, funny looking birds, songs, also we have @CAPS2 accents that we say every word with so it was that much funnier. My stomach muscles hurt so bad i don't know if we were laughing because things were actually funny or if we were delirious from not having much sleep and on top of that on a caffeine high and sugar rush. Once we got to the actual airport we still could not stop laughing @PERSON1's parents were getting frustrated with us even though we were making them crack up also. We all boarded the plane and we sat next to each other of course. We swear still to this day that we had a secret agent sitting behind us he had on spy glasses, a suit and an ear piece @CAPS3 the secret agents wear that protect the president we kept making up stories about what he does we couldn't stop laughing. Finally he started to talk to us. We were very enthused he was telling us all the places he was going the place I remember the most is @LOCATION3 a secret agent! We knew it at this point. We thought how awesome of a job! Of course @PERSON1's parents interrupted "I'm sorry sir, are they bothering you?" @CAPS3 we were some kind of pest, he replied "of course not, i have nothing better to do." We even had him laughing so hard that he was crying i guess you could say we are pretty funny when we are together. The best part was when her mom was having anxiety about flying i mean its not funny but she mad it funny because she was saying things such as "oh my goodness were gonna crash, girls be quiet your freaking me out" etc. @PERSON1 and I took advantage of the situation and made her even more scared. finally we landed. At the airport we went to the restroom and there was free toothbrushes so we took some @PERSON1 took a green one and I took a pink one. we used them all day in pictures and everything. Then we got a rental car and went to the hospital still laughing about everything we got into the hospital and finally seen the baby she was so cute. We started to settle down once we were in the room. After about an hour we went out to eat we were all so hungry. We ate then had to sit around and waste three hours we went to the mall then to @PERSON1's family's house we crashed! @PERSON1 and I were dead! but we still had the flight home, dreading every step we didn't know how we were going to make it. Finally we got on the plane went back to camp and went to sleep. It was one of those "had to be there" days i cant put the emotion and laughter into words it was that funny. We are best friends for a reason were definitely not boring which i think keeps us so close.

  Laughter to me is the best medicine there is, and indeed a big role in any good relationship. It's especially good for a couple who's serious and has forgotten how to laugh. Also for those who could use their mood lifted. I know that laughter made my relationship so much better.  In the begginging my relationship with my boyfriend wasn't so great. We barely laughed with eachother, let alone spoke very much. Only with friends would we laugh and have a good time. Though we weren't much of jokers anyway. All we could do was get upset or just not say anything. Even if the joke was funny.  Well that all changed one night when we decided to go to the @LOCATION1 and play a few rounds of @CAPS1. When we got there we were kind of moody, and I was very short tempered. After we sat down the mood lightened a little. Then we finally got to talking and then one little outburst sent us practically rolling on the ground. We were cracking up. Faces red and gasping for air. We laughed so hard we almost cried, and the jokes didn't stop. Our moods totally changed once that happened. We couldn't even remember why we were upset. Almost like the anger just vanished.  Soon after we realized how rediculous we were and that it's alright to joke around, just so long as it's not mean. Later on we went to a friend's house and had an awsome time. We told a few good jokes, laughed an awful lot, and really had fun. Then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes. I don't know what it was about that night that but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy. Sharing that experience allowed us to really connect with eachother. Not only that, but it strenthened our bond, and brought us closer. Our relationship has been great ever since then. We can laugh and have a good time, without being so serious all the time. I know now why laughter is very important in a relationship.  Despite our little run in with moodiness, all that joking around reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is. It did some things that others never could. Some @MONTH1 not think that laughing is best, but i believe it is. Those little giggles every now and then @MONTH1 not seem like much, but believe me there is so much more than you think. Laughter is everything to me. After what it did for me and my boyfriend, i don't know how i would live without it.

  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, "@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message." "@CAPS5 will we say in the message?", I asked. "@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""@CAPS7", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, "@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..." I burst out laughing before I could continue. "I.. I'm coming over for a visit in..", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, "@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish."@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, "That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime." "For sure", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

 To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS3 or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS1 mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS3 things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS1 boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS1 credit card account was being help for @NUM1 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME1 when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS2 and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a "@CAPS3 vacation" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS1 bank and see what was going on with @CAPS1 account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS1 pin number to access @CAPS1 account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS1 account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS1 stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied "to luxury". Instantly his face lit up and he asked "how" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness.

 Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw back of a head, and a gut busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick-up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. @PERSON1 had a wife who, as well, became a vampire to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to "take better care of your lawn". I sympathized with @PERSON1 for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did.  I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick-up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on @ORGANIZATION1, that this was not part of the routine. After about @NUM1 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. @PERSON1 was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As of on its own, the ball rolled into @ORGANIZATION2's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, @PERSON1 started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. @PERSON1 threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, @ORGANIZATION2's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved.  From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. Once it is brought into your life, it has the powers to heal and restart. That is exactly what it did for @ORGANIZATION2. Through laughter, he got his life back.

So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!

 The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild. To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. "@CAPS1 to go! You're late." @CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began.  The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. @CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person.  Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters.  The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in.

 One day on a stormy night i had gone to the wood shed to get some wood. The wind was thrashing the trees and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking to the moon. I was taking one piece at at time trying to make sure that the pile would not fall on me. As I watched my step i lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head. My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and arrived to my body unconscious. He took me into the shop which is connected to the woodshed out of the cold and turned on the furnace to keep me warm. In doing so he accidentally locked the door from the outside which locked him and me in the shop. As I woke up from my faint sleep with a splitting headache all i could remember happening was the rain pounding against the side of the woodshed. @CAPS2 was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock as well. He told me what had happened with the door getting locked and how we would never get out till morning. I looked around trying to find something to get the door off but couldn't find out what anything was. My parents could not hear us over the storm since they were asleep and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the gloomy side we decided to make some stories and tell jokes to pass the time till it was morning again. As we made up a game called @CAPS1 we found that we had a lot of similar interests and also we laughed at the same jokes. as we laughed the time seemed to fly by as if we were in a time warp. after three hours it seemed that we were both getting hungry and i had a couple snacks in my pockets. so we sat by the furnace and ate and told jokes about our friends and our parents and the laughing kept us cheered up for another three hours. After a while we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky like a ghost leaving this world to the next life. We started making fun of different movies and they're actors and actresses. I started talking about how big @PERSON1's ears were and we both started cracking up with laughter uncontrollably he then came back to me with how big @ORGANIZATION1's lips were and i laughed so hard i couldn't breath. we looked through the holes in the shop to see the morning dew on the grass and birds chirping in trees and i knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. As we waited for our parents to come find us we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew by saying that it wasn't meant for all the times I tried to get us out of the shop or for @CAPS2 pulling me into the shop, no it was for the time we spent together and laughed. It made us closer than we already were and it also gave us a memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror. We have cherished that memory ever since it happened even though we @MONTH1 fight over the most tiny inconsiderate things sometimes and make fun of each other, we know that deep down we do it out of love.

@PERSON1                                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 out with buddies are some of the best @CAPS2 of my life if its an adventure or just a @CAPS1 time @CAPS3 out. I wen stergion fishing for the first time in my life with my buddy @PERSON2, i haven't known him vary long because i just moved to a new school so i just meet him and thought he was a pretty cool guy, he invited me to go fishing with him so i decided to give it a shot. We woke up after only sleeping two hours the night before because we were up all night messing around having a @CAPS1 time. The alarm went off at @TIME2 and we were dead tired, we got the boat ready and we were on our way to the @LOCATION1 river, we go there and unloaded the boat in the river it was by far the coldest i have been and not sure if i was going to have fun because i was wet cold and tired finally the sun came out and it started warming up and we were out on the water by @TIME1 and had the polls ready. We drove the boat to the spot were we were going to fish everyone was saying we are dumb for going to that spot because it was no @CAPS1 but my friends dad was one of the best fisherman i have met so i just went with the flow they taught me a few pointers and before i knew it we were catching fish having a @CAPS1 'ol time. By about the middle of the day it was lunch time but no one really wanted to eat because we were catching so many fish so we waited a while and finally started lunch, talking about all the fish we have caught and all the fun we have had. as the day went on and the sun got lower and lower a long with the tempeture we caught a bunch more fish and it was about time to get off the water so we all limited out and went back to the dock to load the boat back on the trailer and head back home, on the way home all we could talk about was fishing that day and how much fun it was and how many fish we caught.

                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say "@CAPS2 with @PERSON1". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother "@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was "@CAPS8 @CAPS9". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said "@CAPS10's so funny?" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called "@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.

 I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know "live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it." I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing "I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it.

      Well since you guys want to hear a funny story, I got a couple but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my @DATE1. I was living out in @LOCATION1 and it gets pretty hot in the @DATE1. I lived there a couple summers @CAPS1 I know how hot it gets. This @DATE1 I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool that just I could hangout in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool @CAPS1 I could have all my friends come over , hangout , swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo.I went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said "that he would love to get a pool for the @DATE1" cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like I was saying @CAPS2 are expensive and @NUM1 exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of what ever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me @CAPS1 we go down to walmart and look at there pools. There was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not to small , and not to much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to go asked my dad if I could get this one. He said "that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it". Like I told him @NUM1 what I said I was going to do and @NUM1 what i needed to do". We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , @CAPS1 I went back to my house in @LOCATION1 to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @CAPS1 its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. @NUM4 a lot harder on me cause I have no job. @CAPS1 I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and @CAPS2 both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, @CAPS1 out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat.I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called @ORGANIZATION1 and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. @CAPS2 said that "I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and @CAPS2 agreed to give me eighty five bucks. I took there deal but, my bike can't go threw the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that "I could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees". @CAPS1 I borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. I gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike.I'm almost half way to my four hundred. When I was thinking, I got @CAPS1 caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and @NUM5 like "yeah I already knew that @CAPS1 I already bought it". I was @CAPS1 happy that I got my pool. Now I have like two hundred bucks to spend and I didn't know what to buy. @CAPS1 I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool even the parents.We decided to play mar-co polo. Cause I wanted to play. My friend @PERSON1@NUM6 dad who is a huge dude was playing. I said mar-co and he lunged at me. I moved but he kept going, he went straight threw my pools wall and everyone fell out of the pool. i was laughing @CAPS1 hard but I was also upset cause my pool is already broken. Luckily @PERSON1@NUM6 dad is rich, @CAPS1 he bought me another pool. He seen how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick. During the @DATE1 I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn't in my pool, I was on my new bike.

@CAPS4- @CAPS1 Laughter @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 I cannot imagine where my life would be right now with out laughter, who my friends would be, or @CAPS1 I would get through my day. Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives each of us something in common despite our differences. This has been proven true in my life, especially with one person, @CAPS4. I met @CAPS4 a year ago in a class of mine, we never really talked much or knew each other until that one day when she @CAPS2 me laugh. It was juts another day in class doing a lab when I see this short ginger hair girl twitching on a bar stole, I of course immediately begin to laugh. This girl was twitching around on a stole making awkward hand gestures and laughing, making me crack up, and not a single other person finds this funny, they are just giving us the you girls are insane" stare. Others inquire what she is doing, @CAPS4 too hysterical to form actual words, I say "hello dudes she is a dinosaur like from @CAPS7 the @CAPS8, 'I have a bid head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was though out very well....'" @CAPS4 response with a point to me and a head shake, I knew this was the beginning a beautiful, laughter filled, @CAPS3.  There are countless times where laughter was been the center piece of my time with @CAPS4. When we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others even the complete stranger. The best example I can give is when we were at @ORGANIZATION1, a hotel with an in door water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, pictures and a good time, but when we were all dressed up looking your something to do was the high light of the @TIME1. Two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks @CAPS2 our little foursome more insane than usual, giving @CAPS4 the courage to saunter up to very attractive complete stranger and get him to say hello to the birthday girl, me. @CAPS4 and I start to bust a move and proceed to fall to the ground in laughter, at this point most people would think these @NUM1 girls are strange I am leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter even he joined in on the laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @CAPS4's contagious laughter was when we went to see @CAPS1 to @CAPS14 your @CAPS15, believe me when I say this night could have easily down hill very quickly. Basically @CAPS4 was yelling at the movie, cracking, jokes, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make the people around you angry. But for some reason the people around us ate up her humor and found it hilarious, they were laughing along with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never been on such an adventure. They way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friends who is crazy and humorous. @CAPS4 is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do. So go ahead, act like your @NUM2 even if your @NUM3, you never know who you @MONTH1 make laugh and what friends you could make."

 My sister @PERSON3 and my niece @PERSON2 had just came down from @LOCATION2. It had been three years since I last seen them. When my brother @PERSON1, my sister @CAPS1, and I went over to my dads for the weekend we all decided we would go camping over by the beach. That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed we were off to @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a small little town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around you. My dad built a small one roomed cabin there a few summers back. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds fulfilling almost half the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies that we would bring. The whole ride over we were all messing with each other giving one another horse bits, the claw, and pulling on other peoples seat belts so that it would tighten across there chest. We were also telling @PERSON3 funny stories about one another trying to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and fourth scarring @CAPS1. While everyone else was laughing about it she was screaming. That @TIME1 we all decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to go to the beach before noon. @CAPS1 was the only one actually wanting to go to sleep. Everyone but @CAPS1 was trying to make fun out of the rest of the @TIME1. While everyone else was taking @CAPS1 was yelling at them to go to sleep and be quite. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 started yelling random stuff just to make her mad. When everything was silent one of them would yell something like, its not to late to sleep like a baby @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS1 would start yelling while everyone else just busted up laughing. That @TIME1 was one of the funnest nights there. Everything was hilarious that @TIME1 but when look at it now it wasn't all that funny it was just stupid. I believe we made the most fun out of the @TIME1 as we possibly could. It has become one of my most vivid memories. We all look back at it and laugh.

 Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh.

Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, "@CAPS6 your names?" and "@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how "nice" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can.

                                Coleslaw"@CAPS1's get out of here before they wake up @CAPS2." @PERSON2 said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass of my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. "@CAPS3 coming @PERSON5?" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light.  "@CAPS4!" @CAPS14 said and gave me a look of pure anger.  All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was @NUM1 am. It was week five at @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We had made new friends and met new people. @PERSON2 and I were @CAPS15 to help disabled children and @PERSON5 was @CAPS15 to hit on all of the cute guys the worked up @CAPS15 all @DATE1. As @PERSON2 and I walked @CAPS9 to @LOCATION1's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help @CAPS16 feel mad. That was the third time @PERSON5 had been rude to me @DATE2 and i didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, @CAPS16 @PERSON5 didn't like @PERSON3. My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I knew it was going to be a @TIME1. We reached @LOCATION1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. @CAPS15 @CAPS14 was, laying on the couch in her pajamas. Her daughter, @PERSON1, safely tucked away in bed. "@CAPS7 girls!" @CAPS14 exclaimed, "@CAPS8's @PERSON5?"  "@CAPS9 on the field watching the shower with her real friends" I said, making air quotations with my fingers.  @PERSON2 rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. "@CAPS10! @PERSON4, can we sleep in here tonight?"  "@CAPS11!" @PERSON4 said, "@CAPS12 in and lock the door behind @CAPS3."  We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds @PERSON4 made some chocolate milk. "@CAPS13, ladies!" @PERSON4 started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, "I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION1?"  "@CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more." @PERSON2 said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. "@CAPS15 is that." I said, "@CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about @PERSON3. @CAPS3 know cute core-guy @PERSON3?" they nodded, "@CAPS17 I told her about a conversation @CAPS20 and I had @CAPS8 I told a @CAPS18 stupid joke and out of pity @CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool' I was @CAPS18 excited and @CAPS14 was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down."  "That doesn't sound mean." @PERSON2 stated. "@CAPS19! @CAPS14 then went on to tell me that @PERSON3 doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS14 said that @CAPS20 just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me." I was almost shouting, "I mean out loud I agreed with her @CAPS16 in my head i was scream furiously @CAPS20 loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help @CAPS16 laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. "@CAPS3 should right skits for @CAPS22!" @PERSON4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly @PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, "I @CAPS18 want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS23!"  "I could go for some coleslaw right about now." @PERSON4 shrugged. "I could go for some @PERSON3-slaw right about now!" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see @PERSON5 walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. "@CAPS24 it!" @PERSON4 said, "and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my @NUM2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here." I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS9 to the bed. @PERSON5 got to the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS14 found that it was locked @CAPS14 softly knocked on the door. Then @CAPS14 waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, @CAPS14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @PERSON4 gasped, it was @NUM2 in the morning and @CAPS5 would be starting in @NUM4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. @PERSON4 went @CAPS9 to her bed while @PERSON2 and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying @CAPS15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that @ORGANIZATION1 would be @CAPS25. @CAPS16 her being mad was worth what I learned. That @TIME1 I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's @CAPS15 fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be @CAPS26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?

 It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes.
<START>

 Laughter can be a good think and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When me and my family went to @LOCATION3 we went for my two little brothers appointment. We left a little early so we could have some vacation time. When we arrived to where were going we got onto a fairy to go to a island up in @LOCATION1. On are way there my sister @PERSON1 was acting like she was on the titanic she had the dress and everything. My brothers and dad and i just couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. @CAPS5 while we stayed down there we were at are uncles house and they have a little dog and she was running from it and she fell so hard and my family and i weren't trying to laugh at her but it's kinda hard. After we went to lunch with are uncle and aunt we went to there military base @PERSON1 would not keep here hands off of the jets. What my family and i thought was so funny is @PERSON1 is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or younger so i guess we just like to pick on @LOCATION2. When we went to @LOCATION3 it was the night before the boy's appointment and are family and us went to the under ground tour of @LOCATION3. Well after that was all done we went to the gift shop that come's up at the end of the tour well @PERSON1 buys a pin that said something no so good and after she bought it are @CAPS4 had seen it she threw it away because she doesn't like things like that but @PERSON1 pulled out of the trash. After that all of us got hungry so we went to this place where they sale some really @CAPS1 tacos and we got a order and we sat down well we also got some sodas and my other sister and i took a bite of are food and took a drink of are food @CAPS5 @PERSON1 says "oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there" @CAPS5 sierra take the biggest gulp of tapattao and i don't remember what @PERSON1 said but she said something and it made me and sierra bust up laughing and we spit are food all over @LOCATION2 she gets up and screams. So of course are parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them so we all started to walk up to the car and right when are uncle @PERSON3 yelled @PERSON1 don't fall because thins is where i fell all you hear is are sister falling behind us is was so funny. What made it even more funny was that me and sierra just started to stop laughing and oh my goodness we were laughing the whole way to the car. Are whole way home @PERSON1 was mad at us because we were still laughing at her but we went to the beach she was over it. I think when we went to the beach that was the place where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing no cell phones lots of picture rock climbing that was fun we left @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS2 behind a couple of times @CAPS5 @PERSON2 tried to keep throwing me into the water so i would pushed him back @CAPS5 @PERSON2 threw a rock at @LOCATION2 and she fell over. When we were all taking a picture on a @CAPS1 log we were all shaking it and @PERSON1 sierra and i all fell of and i hurt my arm so we had to go to the doctors. A month after we got home are @CAPS4 took @PERSON1, sierra, aunt @PERSON4 and i to @CAPS3 on ice and that was probably the best time of my life. Are @CAPS4 says "i don't know what's funnier @PERSON1 waving to the actors on the ice that cant see her in the dark or the show." @CAPS5 are aunt said"yeah thank you @CAPS6 for making me sit next to her." @CAPS5 when the cartoon toys story came on sierra and i said"look @PERSON1 what are you doing on the ice arena and she thought that we were talking about the pig and we were all no the little troll and @CAPS4 and aunt @PERSON4 just busted up laughing it was hilarious. When we went home we were all talking about it and laughing and she got mad because were always making fun of her because she is short but when it comes to us she thinks its so funny. There is a lot of laughter in our family and i cant wait to have more in it so that when i grow up I'll have a lot of good memories beside me and I'll still look back like i am now and I'll say wow what good times i have had since i grew up. When we are family laughs together i think that is the time when we actually communicate

 I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested "@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan." The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. "@CAPS6!" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2.

                                  "@CAPS1 @DATE1" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.

 Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, "make them laugh". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness.

   @LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my @CAPS1 @CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS7 or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.     Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of "treasures" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, "@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!" @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter.  @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy.

 "@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone," are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. "@CAPS2?" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. "@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. "@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe," she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond.

 My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!

 You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE1 when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that "Laughter is the shortest distant between two people." and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's "Laughter is the greatest medicine." I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days.

 Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those times with my friends and family. I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about.

 In the @DATE1 of @NUM1' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named @PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate @ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM2 in the @TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.

@CAPS1 as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS2 did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS7. My best friend stood @CAPS8 watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS8 I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS7. @CAPS2 was too early for the In a better place" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON2 trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was over-whelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his "stunna-shades" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, "@CAPS3 on, suck @CAPS2 up @CAPS8 take @CAPS2 like a man!" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS8 he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS6 peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS8 met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS6 wished I was him. @CAPS6 loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS8 held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS8 @PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS6 did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS8 pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS2 was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS2 was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. "@CAPS4 @CAPS5." @CAPS6 started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear stained @CAPS8 reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice to the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't know him the way @CAPS6 @CAPS8 I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS8 hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. "@CAPS7 you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?" I felt the question @CAPS3 up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS8 crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS2 had. @PERSON3 smiled @CAPS8 nodded to my relief. "@CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles." I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS2. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. "@CAPS7 you remember how he'd always braid your hair?" @PERSON3 smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS2 overflowed with laughter. When @PERSON1 died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to @CAPS7. @PERSON1 always generated the larger portion of my laughter, @CAPS8 with him gone I never imagined I would @CAPS1 again. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter did. My beatitude in his memory will never die."

 Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and "feel" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch "@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4," because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the "@CAPS5" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have "@CAPS6" and "@CAPS7 @CAPS8" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part.

                                                         Laughter and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Laughter is the key component in anything in life. @CAPS2 is able to turn any sad moment good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a "little bird" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have.
<START>

 Laughter is what I'd like to call a "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like "@CAPS5 @CAPS6" and "@CAPS7 help me" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!
<START>

 I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS3 I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE1 @TIME1. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS1 versus and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON1,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS3 so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever.

          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life.

 When I was about thirteen me and my older brother dissuaded we where going to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, throw on a pair of old torn up blue jeans and when downstairs to get some breakfast. On my way I could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and and I reached for the bottle of @CAPS1.Ethan was sitting across from me as i ate and said"We'll leave in an hour or so".I said okay and went on eating.After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of jacked of the old neighbor lady. We put our stuff in the van and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is. There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it. It was a small creek. I grew up on it so I thought i knew what to expect. We put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly @DATE1 morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should wear his waiters. I thought it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat. Burt I put them on and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting.   As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world. As we took the next corner there it was. A water fall about as tall as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it. We where pushed right up agenced the rock and where all most thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life.We where stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way.So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being om the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second. When the boat sunk my waiters filled up instantly and and it took all i had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar and that stupid boat. It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me. I was scared for my life now. This was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival. We couldn't turn back now. the only way to got home was to go the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and didn't have any options. We had to continue so we tried it again just to sink. We spent most of that day carrieing the boat around rapids and throw brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in. We got to a big pool, so big you could fit a house in it. There where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it. It dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we went we burly braised the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in. I tried to keep from sinking but my waiters where to heavy. As i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream. Being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it. The water was faster then I thought as I let it @CAPS2 me. I was swallowing so much water and i couldn't breath. I could feel it begin to get deeper and soon I couldn't touch bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally got to it with burly anything left. I got to shore and just law there choking up water. After ten minuets I got up and went back. I think it was freak luck we survived that day but some how we did. I learn a lot that day and laugh about it now.

  It is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life sometime laughter gets you out of trouble sometimes get you in to trouble. but the more we laugh the more we are going to be happy. I time that laughing came in handy was in @CAPS2 school.  In the @NUM1 grade @CAPS3 person was split into a group. The popular girls, band nerds, hippies, and the jocks. The lunch room was always how you knew who was who. The popular girls would sit with the jocks everyone of the girls had a boy to flirt with, the band nerds on the floor making straw recorders and drums out of milk cartons, the hippies all in a circle eating salad out of one tray. None of these groups ever intercepted each other.  I fell into the group of the hippies. we wore green everyday and peace signs on as many clothing we were able to get on our tiny little bodies. We were the nicest group, We helped with @CAPS3 @CAPS1 friendly activity there was to do. We did recycling everyday. My @CAPS2 school experiences was outstanding. The best thing about our group was that we knew how to laugh, we would giggle chuckle, or laugh so hard that our mouths were open and we were holding our gut but no sound would come out.  On a beautiful @DATE1 @TIME1 we decided to sneak out of the lunch room, why did we? I don't know. We all just really wanted to sit outside and eat. The golden rule at lunch time was: @CAPS3 person had to raise their hand to be excused and then take a green card to be able to @CAPS4 outside. After you got a green card you had to take it to the outside teacher which showed her/him that you could be outside. But instead of waiting to get excused, we walked all the way around the other side of the building to sneak around to the bright green lawn that was filled with flowers. I don't know how we managed to sneak around with no teacher seeing us, but we did. When we saw that bright green lawn we ran to it like a four year old running to a ice cream truck. We all skipped, danced and ate our lunches that our mom's packed us. we all sat in a circle and passed around food. the day couldn't get any better. In a matter of fact it got worse. when we were done eating we went and played on the play ground forgetting that we weren't aloud outside in the first place. We swung on the swings, climbed on the monkey bars. we were screaming, laughing talking. Which led to a teacher coming over and told all of us to come to her. Her voice was calm like she was trying to keep a bear down her throat so it wouldn't come out and eat us. We sat there with big bug eyes and all held hands. The teacher said we were in really big trouble, and there would be really bad consequences. And we all knew that before she told us. A few seconds after she told us that, I just started laughing really hard. I couldn't stop, it was like someone put a spell on me to never stop laughing. Everyone looked at me like seriously you pick right now to bust out laughing. I was on the ground curled up in a ball with my hands holding my stomach and my face was bright red. I couldn't stop laughing. Finally i got a hold of myself i looked up at everyone around me looking down at me. I looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing. We all sat there in silence staring at her. Now she was the one on the ground, I couldn't even believe it. she looked at all of us, and said "@CAPS4 have fun, it is a beautiful day out and you girls are nice ones, i will let it @CAPS4 this time, but just don't do it again". We all hugged her and ran off to the swings and monkey bars. To this day i will never forget that moment. Just a simple laugh got us out of being in so much trouble. who would of thought. it is true that, laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life. having laughter in life makes the world @CAPS4 round.

 Laughter, one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laughter with friends, family, and with people we do not even know. We all can enjoy and share laughter, it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender, or disability. We all can enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, but yet complex in many ways. It is like falling into a pool of @CAPS1. Laughter, just the word "laughter" brings me joy! When our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter, it is like a tool. It is the thing that has helped me make new friends. Also, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies. It has also aided me into achieving the things I want. Laughter is @CAPS2 my middle school years. My family and I moved a lot, and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you, and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I have made new friends, and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again. It gets difficult to make new friends, but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so much I just got used to making new friends, and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy. A tool for just making friends. After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends, because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends, and then transfer to another school, and then start all over and make new friends again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades. Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends, because I stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Also, when people get older the type of humor people enjoy changes. As time went by I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so they can be your friend. It was about getting to now the person, and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not easy, but it also is not very hard. All you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste in humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. It is what puts people in a good mood. We as people @MONTH1 have our differences, but we can still all laugh together. It feels very good when you get a good laugh, but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces.

 In the story i am going to tell you, it involves one of my friends and myself. After school one day meself and a buddy of mine went to my house for the night. It was alot of fun, we started off playing video games and laugh really hard when one of us would die in the game. Then after awhile of that it was dinner time and my mom told us to get off and come eat. it was really fun at dinner, we throw stuff at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was a blasted, until dinner was over and we didn't have anything to throw at each other anymore. But now it was time to start playing games again. Now at this time it was about teen o'clock and we were getting really tried so we put in the movie step brother and watched it. It was the best time we had all day we were laughing non stop at everything that was said in the movie and it was great. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning. But before we could my friends dad was there to pick him up so that was the end of the best time with my friend and the funnyest time ever too. It was great we laught non stop the whole night. Now that just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.

Have @CAPS1 ever had that one friend who was your best friend, that @CAPS1 could go to for anything, that @CAPS1 were so close to that @CAPS1 guys knew everything about each other, from the way their nose flared when they laughed to their deepest darkest secret. Well @PERSON2 was that type of best friend to me. Us two crazy monkeys became friends in first grade. We were never the type of girls to sit down in class and read a book or stay calm all throughout school, no, we were the girls playing sports with the boys, getting dirty and scratched up. We always were laughing and playing and having a great time. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because,well, we were always laughing. We would get in trouble for keeping our parents up late at @TIME2 with our crazy jokes, loud laughing, and hyper psychotic ninja adventures we would take during the middle of the @TIME2. No matter what we were doing, we could always make a joke out of it all. " @CAPS1 guys are perfect together" said my mom one day, and all I had to say in reply to that was " I know, we are two monkey ninjas."  @PERSON2 and I had this one restaurant that we loved to go to, it was @PERSON1 @PERSON1. @CAPS2, @PERSON2 s @CAPS5 would take us to there at least twice a month and we would always get the same exact thing every single time. @PERSON2 and I could make some things funny that no one else understood. We would sit there in the booth with @CAPS2 and talk about the funny times, the stupid fights, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout the time we were at @ORGANIZATION1. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1, @PERSON2 had come over to my house and was planning on spending the @TIME2. We had our whole @TIME2 planned out, we were going to call her @CAPS5 and talk him into taking us to @PERSON1, and when we got back home we were going to go on a jog, then get ready to go on an "adventure" is what we liked to call them. So we called @CAPS2 and had creatively talked him into taking us. But the catch was, was that we had to go over to @LOCATION1 s house mow the yard, plant some plants, weed some of the garden and then he would take us. So we went of course and did all the work that we agreed on doing, and we went to @ORGANIZATION1, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted. By this time everyone at @ORGANIZATION1 knew our names by heart. We made jokes with them and sometimes even got to go in the back room and get our ranch if there wasn't too many people there. We ate our food, got extra fries, extra ranch, and were sitting there with full bellies. We were all ready to leave, but @CAPS2 had to go to the bathroom. So @PERSON2 and I sat there and waited while he was in the restroom. He was taking a longer amount of time than he usually does, which was fine with us because we wanted to talk about this one boy that @PERSON2 was having a "thing" with, which we couldn't talk about while her @CAPS5 was around. Finally he comes out of the bathroom, and i notice his zipper is down but he is so close I didn't want to say anything to @PERSON2 about it until we were further away from him, and him being in his playful hyper mood wouldn't let us get far enough away from him so I could tell her. As we were walking out of the door, I finally told @PERSON2 to tell her @CAPS5 that his zipper was down. So as she turns and looks she bursts out into laughter because while his zipper is down he is talking to a group of people that work there. So as we are both laughing hysterically we are trying to tell him. We finally got him to start walking out of the door, and at that time @PERSON2 says between giggles " @CAPS5 your zipper is down," he looks down and does his nervous/oh my goodness laugh and zips it up.  The whole ride home, @PERSON2 and I are busting a nut laughing as hard as we could. Our stomachs were about to explode because of laughing so hard. @CAPS2 was in the front seat occasionally giggling because he couldn't believe that his zipper was down the whole time. And as we were nearing my house he says " there was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry and write the lyrics before they were over, I really liked that song ." That to me, was the funniest thing @CAPS2 ever said. @CAPS2 went home and bought the song on i @CAPS7, and also learned to check his zipper more often. @PERSON2 is the perfect best friend for me, we are just a like in many ways. But our sense of humor is the most alike.

 Laughter is the best medicine for a friend in pain. My friend @CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while I waited for him I decided to ride my bike. I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how i felt, but it didn't hurt any more. I got better because laughter is the best medicine.

 The elements of laughter is to show emotion to other to let them know that you had a great time or to show that there are special. Laughter is some times in me. I laught when I have a great time. The greates laughter I always have is with friends saying crazy thing when we go to the bus after school. That the joy from friend and you to reales the tens strees from school. I always go home with a smile. Theres always jokes to tell to have joy. When the bell rings with in the end of my last class, I am tierd from working hard. When I go to my bus located on the front of the school. I feel strees out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a great time. I comepletely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and rediculace story we say. When we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me. This prosses has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be ower last ride from the bus @NUM1 my favorite number. I hope we will still have the great time.

 The new trimester had started and leadership was my second period. With no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were, I was skeptical on taking the class. After days of taking the class, I began to enjoy it more and more. After a week or so, the teacher announced we would be on stage helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly. I had never done anything of the sort so I was somewhat excited. Days went by and the entire class practiced setting up the assembly, running to our places, moving props, and stacking chairs. The day of the assembly finally arrived, it was time for the show. The students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains. Everything was set up perfectly. The curtains rose and the assembly began. My peers and I stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold. The school band preformed a long boring set of songs, the curtains fell and the entire leadership class ran out on stage, picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used. After, we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage. The choir was now going to preform, we then retreated back behind the curtains.  The choir sang their songs, and we watched, but as they proceeded to set up for their last song, students moved around leaving a large open spot in the top row. With the choirs last song, they preformed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song. My leadership class friends and I, noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had enough courage to do it. The choir finished their song and dance, the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again. The students came in, sat in their seats, the band played, we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again. Finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room and put on a choir robe, put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead, and stepped up onto the bleachers.  She took the open spot in the top row. The song began as well as the dance. She broke into random dancing, not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members. It was obvious she did not belong up there. The crowd soon began to realize what was going on. Laughter broke out in the seats, but soon after laughter broke out behind the stage as well. I was laughing like I had never laughed before. It was painful, tears pouring down my face, I was gasping for air. Running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale, when right at that moment the song had a dead silent pause. The auditorium went completely silent, I inhaled in, and as I took in that air, my body managed to let out an extremely loud embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me, I knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed I laughed even harder, causing more pain, tears, and lack of oxygen.  The song ended followed by the end of the laughter, then by the end of the assembly. The girl stepped down from the bleachers and we all scrambled out of the building, hiding the robe along the way. We laughed all the way to our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Giggles filled the school for hours. Talk of who it was, what actually happened, and why it happened were on everyone's minds, except for ours. The second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details. The following days however, the teachers also got word of it. Not thinking our actions all the way through, we would soon have to face the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and child-like. We had a plethora of possible punishments, in school suspension, @DATE1 school, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in leadership. After the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration, we got out of it with having one day of @DATE1 school and apologizing to the entire choir class. The school board, realized it was just a joke, letting us off easier than it could have been. In my eyes the prank was well worth it. For weeks on end, every night I would go to bed laughing about that leadership assembly.

 Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  "@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter.

 Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. @CAPS1 can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand @CAPS7 powerful. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met @PERSON1. @CAPS1 only took the move of my former @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship @CAPS1 all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received. At the time i was part of a small @CAPS3 group, in a small church, in a small town. @CAPS3 @CAPS2, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 were moving, and would no longer be able to lead the @CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the @CAPS3 that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest , including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't what would have happened. Many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed. As a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had. But that was just a thought. Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from @LOCATION1 was traveling here to our small town in @LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door. His name was @PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! @CAPS7 could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen of him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, @CAPS7 he had grown up, and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a @CAPS3 group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew @PERSON1 would be our new @CAPS3 @CAPS4 I still didn't want to accept @CAPS1. I tried and tried to avoid him although @CAPS1 always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, @PERSON1 decided @CAPS1 was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One @DATE1 @TIME1 my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? @PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate @CAPS4, because @CAPS1 would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves. " your mom didn't tell you @CAPS6 your here, did she?"I laughed, " @CAPS6 no she didn't" " @CAPS7 do you feel you and I talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?""um....ok @CAPS7 do you feel about going to @ORGANIZATION1?" The question was puzzling to him, @CAPS1 did to most, but he accepted the idea. "@CAPS8 @CAPS6 are we going to @ORGANIZATION1?" he said as he pulled into the parking lot." I don't know @CAPS1 was just the first thing that popped into my head."We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building @CAPS1 started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. @CAPS1 surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things. He told me more of his childhood like @CAPS7 he was adopted and what @CAPS1 was like before hand and afterwards. @CAPS1 was wierd that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with @PERSON1 and now I was walking around @ORGANIZATION1 laughing and just having a good time. That was about three years or so ago. Shortly after @PERSON1 had to leave. Many rumors were told @CAPS6 because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at @ORGANIZATION1 had happended.

 Though my sister and I have very different personalities, and much of the time do not find humor in the same things we have still shared some humorous moments. It's the times you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someones company instead of letting it bug you.  One sunny day in @LOCATION1 I had some how convinced my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it. The pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and I to @CAPS1 on. The pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks ans geese and of course their droppings as well. We always thought of the ponds water as one of the most disgusting things on earth. We got our roller-blades on and carefully stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car wile we made our laps around the lake. As we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over.We let that thought pass and continued in our rout. On our next lap around we heard a woman yelling. we looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside down boat. "That date was defiantly unsuccessful", I thought. We could hardly contain our selves from bursting out with laughter. We roller bladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't. She basically body slammed the car, fell back, and rolled right underneath it. My dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home.

 When I told my mom that I wanted to @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to @LOCATION1, she laughed. Her laugh was one of utter sarcasm, as if she was saying, "Is this a joke?". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for @NUM1 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to @LOCATION1 with my school's band with a cost of roughly @MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that not only was meaningful, but also efficient. What better way to do that then to do a long distance @CAPS5; a skill that I not only loved, but was also good at? The plan started small; I would @CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise with some friends, wanting to raise about @MONEY2. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for @NUM1 hours would entitle me to over @NUM3 consecutive miles.So what if I was fifteen years old and had never even ran a marathon before? Something in me told me it was possible. And so we laid out the plan; I was to @CAPS5 about @NUM4 miles a week, with three hour runs on @DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repeats, running backwards, and many, many lunges. For some reason, both my coach and I agreed that I could do it.  Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, @PERSON1, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to raise @MONEY2, he looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called "@CAPS1". @PERSON1 taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helping me create a flier to put up in coffee houses, and a way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also wanted to participate in the all-@CAPS4 @CAPS5, and thus was created the running "shifts". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to @CAPS5 with me, ten businesses who sponsoring me, and four "drivers" who drove cars with mattresses, food, and water in the back to support me and my "crew". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The @CAPS4 of the "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 All-@CAPS4 @CAPS5" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to @CAPS5, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early @DATE4, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @DATE1, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool @CAPS4. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after @NUM5 miles for a bathroom break around @TIME1 and realizing that I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless @CAPS4, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That @CAPS4, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless @CAPS4, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop.  The sunrise that rose the morning of @DATE2 at @NUM6 am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. @NUM7 miles behind me, and well over @NUM8 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost-covered world on with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible.
<START>

 My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON2. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, "just done with all this." I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, "@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me." We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do.

 The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. "@CAPS2, hey guys!" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. "@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said "@CAPS8," and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come.

 The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always @PERSON1 is superior and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS3's home!   By now it is @NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON1 undertakes @ORGANIZATION2! The thief in @PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON2 screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON1 is younger than @ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever.

                                                 Learning to laugh    @DATE1 as we were vacationing in @LOCATION2, I realized that laughter is a big part of our lives, and an important factor that can keep friends and families together. Not too long ago I also discovered that laughter can relieve you from stress, and it even helps you lose weight, which, I thought was pretty interesting. My sister on the other hand still did not quite believe that laughter could do all of that. She thought it was just being blown out of proportion. She believed that if her friends didn't want to hang around with her, then there was something wrong with them, that if we didn't have enough food in the house, it was probably my parents fault. There was always some one to blame for whatever happened to her, there was always a bad side to everything. But that @DATE1 it was going to be different she was about to find out that she didn't have to live her live that way, because there is always an alternative.     The trip to @LOCATION2 was something everyone was expecting, even me. I was actually really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. Everybody packed their things, we got ready to leave, got on the car and left to the air port. My aunt @CAPS1 was already waiting for us at the @LOCATION2 city airport. Everything was going great. So far... When we got there, my aunt drove all of us to our little town in the state of @LOCATION1, just about an hour and a half away from the airport. As we were getting there I noticed my sister had a strange look on her face, she seemed somehow confused, lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something."@CAPS2's wrong with you, are you okay? you look all weird..." I said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to start a conversation."@CAPS3 face is all weird!"she said and that was the @DATE1 thing she said to me until we reached our destination.  As we got to our grandparents house we begun to see all our family members already waiting for us outside. The joy of seeing them there was incredible. I looked around around and i saw my sister, I was glad that she looked happy, i thought she was actually enjoying the moment. I did not know @CAPS2 was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard. During my time there I met new family members, saw some old familiar faces and remembered some good and also bad memories, memories which I thought had vanished from my mind already. Turns out they were still there, all the way at the back of my head were I had tried to hide them so that they would never come up again, but somehow they managed to get out and make their way into my thoughts again, and that is when I started to feel like a monster once again. Suddenly I had a flash back to the time when we came to visit, a couple of years ago. That's when it all came to me i saw the whole scene once again I felt horrible. There she was, my little sister @PERSON1 playing in the swings, suddenly she let go of the swing and she felt right into a mud puddle that was there. Every body laughed, I laughed. I thought it was funny, but she didn't laugh, she didn't cry either, she just got up and ran inside.  I never stopped to ask her if she was okay, I didn't realize how my actions had affected her. It was all my fault, I knew she was really sensitive when it came down to some specific situations, but I did not help her, I didn't give her the comfort and support she needed from her big sister, so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going. That would have been a nice advice to give her instead of laughing at her. Then, after a couple of minutes of reflection about it, I went up to her and apologized, she looked a little confused at first, but then she realized where i was going. This made the rest of the trip a lot more easier, now that I knew @CAPS2 was wrong, we both tried our best to fix the problem and work on her self esteem.  Laughter was the perfect therapy for her. All she needed to do was to learn how to laugh about her self when things did not go the way she wanted them. It was hard but we accomplished our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter, and she learned to get back up from her mistakes. Life taught both of us an important lesson that @DATE1. I'm sure that was one of the most exciting trips we've ever taken and the memories from that trip will stay with us forever.

Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the "nervous laugh" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling.

 It all began one morning when I heard my hulking mass of an alarm-clock spouting off again. So I reached over and pushed the button to turn the exceedingly loud contraption off. When I noticed that I have woken up ten minutes late, and so I jumped out of the bed and sprinted to the shower. When I was finished, I got dressed in my @CAPS1-shirt and jeans, which is what I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and placed it in my pocket. Having dealt with the situation at hand, I went down the stairs and into the kitchen to prepare the modest meal of oatmeal. After I was finished eating, I packed up my books and walked back up the stairs to brush my teeth. After doing so, I swiped my coat and hat in one fell swoop. I secured them to my person, grabbed my back-pack , and walked out the door. I stood there on that cold and rainy morning, pondering what the day would hold for me. Suddenly , their was a great noise, I turned to face the approaching threat only to find that the bus had arrived. My mind quickly recovered from @CAPS2 slightly startled state and I stepped onto the bus. The bus ride was no different from the others, kids squawking about what happened at school yesterday, what they are doing @CAPS2 @DATE1, and other seemingly useless conversation. There I sat my eyes fixed gazing out the window of the bus, watching , studying , and mapping the present course of the massive vehicle. We stopped at one of the bus stops, and on the bus came my good friend @PERSON1. As usual she came and sat down next to me and we started talking about the usual cars, music, and the occasional jokes. As I started to develop a creative and captivating joke, she just belted one out right off the top of her head. We both just started busting up laughing, I even felt a tear form in the pit of my eye. We didn'@CAPS1 stop laughing until we got to the school,and my joke was successfully forgotten.  The joke lingered in my head all day long, to @CAPS2 day I still think it is one of the best I've ever heard. Through all of the countless jokes, underhanded comments, and puns I've heard, that one brought about the most laughter of all. But then @PERSON1 moved away to another city, @CAPS2 was a sad day. The very next day I heard the age old saying, "@CAPS2 one time at band camp.....", story and laughter was restored to my life. I learned something that day that friends my move away but the jokes that were said will still remain.

 It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!
<START>

Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome.

                                                The Laughter In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are so many elements in a person's life that are important. Many are to make friends, be successful, but mostly to find happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life right? The biggest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is believed to make you and others around you truly happy. One element to laughter being important in a relationship would be optimism to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a pessimistic, rude, unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time.After all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things. Your partner will get sick of you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a whole lot easier.It @MONTH1 not seem like much but it takes some stress off your shoulders if you have a good time and kick some giggle's. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend our girlfriend and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh they thought it was the most annoying thing in the world? Studies show they would be more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that is the reason you dont want to laugh, I would stick with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that let us get away with alot. Lastly, @CAPS2 is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship and that is happiness. You need to laugh to to be happy. Without laughter what is a smile? Without laughter how will happiness shine through? Lif e can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smiling, no laughing, not fun! When you laugh, it helps others to laugh and have a good time. Plus, its fun! Like when you laugh so hard you cry or when you need to go to the bathroom really bad and it makes it worse when you start busting up laughing. Laughing makes memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you have learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important to anyones life, relationship or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better. :)

 Hello my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS11 i am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences i have ever had. It is a story about me @CAPS11 my friends @CAPS11 a little adventure we had @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE1 air, @CAPS11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS11 meet up with his cousin "@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by." @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS11 looked an @PERSON1 @CAPS11 said "lets go!" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS11 food @CAPS11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE1 loop @CAPS11 @CAPS10 what happened. "@CAPS5 it is" yelled @CAPS2 "@CAPS5's the park i found it." We looked off in the distance @CAPS11 @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS3 had @CAPS7 so @CAPS3 called them @CAPS11 had them come @CAPS11 unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS11 a half to find us @CAPS11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousins house @CAPS11 stayed @CAPS5 for the @TIME1. When we got @CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @CAPS11 warm clothes, "looks like you guys have had a rough one" @CAPS3 said, "I'm @PERSON2, I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now." @CAPS8 we changed in to the clothes @PERSON2 had given us we went @CAPS11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS5 @CAPS11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said "i wish we could have a big fire on the beach." "we can" @PERSON2 said, "i know the perfect place." @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house, @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. "@CAPS10, told you i had the perfect spot." @CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS11 on through the @TIME1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, @CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends.

     Laughter means a lot in a relationship in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughter can mean a few things. It can mean that you are having fun and that you're enjoying life. All of @CAPS4 friendships and relationships contain laughter. Half of the time we laugh, the other half we express ourselves. Laughter could also mean the beginning or ending of a relationship. A lot of people would think that laughter is a joyful reaction, but sometimes a person could be laughing because they are nervous. But I think what we are talking about here is the joyful kind. All of @CAPS4 friendships contain laughter, but they also contain the moments when someone needs to be listened to or heard. One of @CAPS4 friendships that contains a lot of laughter is with @CAPS4 friend @PERSON3. Ever since the day that I first met her, we've laughed a lot. Usually, its @PERSON3 being the joker and me being the audience along with a few other people. But, there are also moments that don't have laughing involved. Moments, when @PERSON3 can be a great listener.     Making jokes and giggling can show how close you are to someone. Like @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2 and I. She's one of @CAPS4 closest friends. We share everything with each other, well at least almost everything. We tell each other whats going on in our families and all that good stuff. But there are so many moments that are just filled with laughing, giggling and making up jokes about @CAPS5 knows what. Whether its twisted in some weird way or even when it doesn't make sense we still laugh about it. It doesn't matter how stupid I @MONTH1 act around her, we always laugh it off and make fun of each other. Not in a bad way.      Usually, when people fall down, they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say. There was a time that I was sitting on @CAPS4 friend, @PERSON4's skateboard, just sitting and rolling up and down the sidewalk, when I came upon a bump. I'm pretty sure you could guess what happens next. I flew off the skateboard and landed on @CAPS4 butt on the cement. I sat there for a second and just stared. Shocked that I had flew off of a skateboard while just sitting down. Pretty disappointing. But the next thing I knew, I was laughing, like it didn't even matter that I had just landed on @CAPS4 butt, infront of one of @CAPS4 friends. @PERSON4 was laughing too. I didn't mind. @PERSON4 didn't even tease me about it. Laughing can shrug things off your shoulders helping you turn it into a joke. That's what I did.     @CAPS4 relationship with @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is full of jokes. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 is the type of guy @CAPS5 just loves to tell jokes and/or act like some historical figure to confuse people. When I answer the phone half of the time @CAPS4 @CAPS1 tries to see if I'll fall for one of his little tricks. One time, he tried saying that he was @PERSON1 and that he invented all these different electrical items. I shook @CAPS4 head was like, "@CAPS1, you're not very good at acting." @CAPS2 he said, "I'm not your @CAPS1. this is seriously @PERSON1." I laughed and said "@PERSON1 is dead. How could he be talking to me over the phone when he's dead, @CAPS1? I know it's you." @CAPS4 @CAPS1 laughed, "@CAPS5 told you I was dead? Obviously, I'm still here, little lady." I smiled, "@CAPS6 huh. Sure. And I'm not a little lady." "@CAPS7 fine, I give up. You can't get a joke, can you?" , he said. I frowned, "Of course I can what are you talking about, @LOCATION1? It's just you're not very good at acting." "@CAPS7 sure, blame it on me." , he laughed, "where's your mother?" That's when the joke ended of course, but @CAPS4 @CAPS1 and I actually have a strong relationship. He's @CAPS4 adopted @CAPS1, in case that hasn't been mentioned. So, when I first met him, we weren't as close as you could probably guess. But after a year, we got closer and I learned that I could trust him. And that half of what he says is basically a joke. Sometimes, I wonder if he ever knows how to be serious, so he doesn't confuse people, for example, me.     For me, relationships should always have laughter otherwise it just makes it all serious. Making it very hard to stay close, in @CAPS4 opinion. And me, myself, I like laughing and having close friends. Because when I'm feeling down, it's always nice to have someone there to make you smile and laugh. It's a great quality to be able to laugh and help people. Without laughter in the world, like I said before the world would be too serious, way too serious. @CAPS5 would want that? I wouldn't. That would be terrible.  When people laugh, it makes the world a better place to live in, in @CAPS4 opinion. Laughing is a gift, a very special gift.

 To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid.

 Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life. Without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  In @ORGANIZATION1 we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked, my partner and I would have hated each other. We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with, and I was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or "cat juices" on us. First, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. We had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. It stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it. My friends support there when I needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. So as you can clearly see, without laughter I would not be able to do some of the day to day things I do at school.

 A couple years ago when I was in middle school I meet one of my bestfriend which who I have great times with. When I first meet her was in math class where she had an assigned seat next to me. We started talking and eventhough we did'nt know each other very well i could say laughter was the closest distance between me and her. We would just laugh at really random things that happened because we did'nt really know what to talk about. Sometimes it would'nt make sence of what we were laughing about. But we laughed any way eventhough we did'nt understand each others jokes.Laughing was something that keped our distance close. Time went by and we became good friends. Laughing was the one thing that keped us cose together because we had nothing better to do. We both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored. If me or her had no humor when we first meet I don't think we would of got along so well at the end. We did'nt really have anything to do because we did'nt know each other very good. We would only hang out during lunch and any other class we had together but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny which was really dumb. We had nothing better to do.  A couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter. We knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common. Laughter still had something to do with our friendship but not as much as the begining of when we first meet. During math time we were always talking and laughing at the things we would say. That had never happened before. But now we were able to talk about other things too not just things that made us laugh and we new that laughter is'nt the only thing that is keeping us colse together. Now we had other ways to get along too. We both had friends that we could get along with differenlty. I had some friends with not a really close distance but we would laugh a lot. With some of my other friends I did'nt really laugh that much and we had a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in different ways not just in laughter. We all have differents ways to get along and have fun. Some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me. Mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other.  I think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close together. Laughing does help people have a good time together but I don't think is a big, big part of a friendship. I think its how they get along and if the have somethings on common. It also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other. Everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so I think it's different for everybody.

 Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS1 that when a guy try's to "pick up" or "hit on" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to "break the ice". When that so called "ice" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT1, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON1 and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON1 I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, "@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you." @CAPS3 meant a lot to me, for @PERSON1 is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS3 was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON1 feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship.

 I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. "@CAPS1 butts, unless, that "@CAPS2" is an "@CAPS3" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4." I said. @CAPS8 was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS7 later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS8 was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS8 taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS8 was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @CAPS8 inside his ear @CAPS7 he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS8 was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS7 we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: "@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha." @CAPS7 I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS7 I said: "@CAPS8 burns so bad. My nose is burning." All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON1 who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS7 turned and asked @PERSON1 if they where @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS6't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities.

 Laughter... what is laughter? Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is? I wish I could but I can't, describing laughter is like describing what water taste like or feels like (besides using the word wet) it's just one of those things that you think its easy to describe to someone because it's a part of your every day life but in reality it's one of the most complex things there could be out there.Even though I can't describe it I do have general concept of it.  Now there's many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it. In my case I believe I'm a person that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 laughs once a day. I laugh all the time from my friend falling , hearing a joke , remembering something in the past , from just pure exhaustion (yes I laugh @CAPS1 times when I'm just so worn out and stressed) the list go's on and on. In short I live my life laughing every day. I don't think I'm such a happy go lucky person that makes others laugh alongside her, but I have gotten comments from my friends saying that's the case. This is one of the wonders of laughter if you see someone laughing enjoying their time you just somehow end up laughing along side them. It makes me happy when I hear one of my friends say " oh @PERSON1 you just made my day..." why? It makes me happy because I know that, that friend just now I was able to make even if just a little a nice day. One time in my life though I met someone, someone that now I hold very dear, someone who I just can't picture my life without that someone would be right to say he lost his laughter. It was @DATE1, and my friend @CAPS3 had invited me to The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in @CAPS6 to meet up with some of her @CAPS4 friends. The reunion with her friends was @CAPS1 this coffee shop. I knew no one but her so i felt out of place. So after just sitting back like a wall flower I decided to go to the ice cream shop just next to the coffee shop and when I realized one of the boys in our group decided to come as well. We hanged out he told me about himself I told him about myself as well.  After that day we stayed connected we had long hour conversations through this video calling site called @ORGANIZATION1. We chatted in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 every singled day, and pulled all nighters on the phone just talking to each other. After around a month of talking and staying connected we became more close, close enough for him to talk about more serious matters with me.   Well now this boy I hold very dear to me has had such a hard life. Where could I possibly begin to tell you the hardships his been through. Oh what about the fact that his adoptive ...hhmmm nah many people out there are adopted that's not that harsh for most. Okay what about the fact that his adoptive father abused of him every chance he got and his adoptive mom literally sat back and watched him do it, not good enough? Okay what about the fact that the one thing that kept him going his friend, the one that was all ways next to him. His to say child hood friends, the child hood friend you can do @CAPS9 in the world yet would not judge, would not think the worst of you if you did something to be ashamed of, the one that was willing to stay up with you for days in a row just for you not to cry your self to sleep. That friend of him passed away in a car rec in his second year of middle school. His life consisted of waking up in the mornings walking to school and being ignore by everyone around him. Coming back from school and putting up with your adoptive family screaming @CAPS1 him, called him names ending up to being beaten just because they can.  Do you think he laughed? Well actually he did but, his laugh was not a laugh of joy. Even though he laughed it was as if nothing no feeling what so ever was behind that laugh a robotic laugh. This for me is such a hard thing to stand. It tears me up because this person is someone very dear to me his such a wonderful individual his just now part of my life and I cant see him out of it now. Yet he is suffering he cant even laugh and feel joy. Up to this day I still see him and I have decide that one day for sure I will make him laugh. We laugh when we talk but I want him to experience the laugh he has yet to have experience and I know one day for sure he will.

 When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him.

I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how "high" or "drunk" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important.

 They say laughter is the best medicine @CAPS15 I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny @CAPS15 some or @CAPS14 plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is @CAPS5 great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood @CAPS15 i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad @CAPS15 upset it @CAPS14 isn't me. I @CAPS14 love it when i cant breathe i am laughing @CAPS5 hard those are the best jokes also you @CAPS11 about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish @CAPS15 i know quite a few people that are @CAPS15 i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time.  Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one @CAPS15 its one of my favorites its when me @CAPS15 my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my @NUM1 birthday party @CAPS15 were all having a great time on the homemade slip @CAPS15 slide the food @CAPS15 the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin @PERSON1 has these games that he came up with like the @CAPS1 relay , @CAPS2 fishing , @CAPS3 the gum in the whip cream, @CAPS15 my favorite @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a game where you @CAPS11 have as many players as you want @CAPS15 all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons @CAPS15 one person to start out as the @CAPS4. @CAPS5 say you have @NUM2 humans @CAPS15 one @CAPS4 all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists @CAPS15 they all try @CAPS15 run away from the @CAPS4 @CAPS15 the @CAPS11 hide anywhere inside the boundaries @CAPS15 it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped @CAPS6 your a @CAPS4 until there are @CAPS12 humans left @CAPS6 you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny @CAPS15 now I am gonna tell you why. @CAPS5 were all at my party having a great time right @CAPS5 my cousin @PERSON1 says "@CAPS5 who wants to play the game @CAPS4?

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and I relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up, and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about, or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard. This last @CAPS1 @CAPS2's eve for example, it started snowing at around three a.m, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together. Having her there to laugh with me, made the situation a lot better.  Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny, was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. With out my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot, is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had, had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and I relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up, or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side.

      It was midsummer, and i could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, "he's not home, but i'll let him know you called". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @DATE1 and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since @TIME1. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life. Im glad that i found someone special enough to always keep me laughing. It's like we never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there's nothing for you. Remember to laugh, it's what makes the world go round.

 Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face. If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place.  My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn't seem like there was many options. We lived clear out of town about @NUM1 miles, not exactly walking distance.

 I woke up just like any other day happy yet lacking sleep. As i got out of bed i would have never known that to day would be the funniest day of my life. I got ready for school after getting out of bed. When i got to school every thing seemed like our normal homecoming tell there was a announcement on the intercoms that had told every body out of no where there was a dance tonight. So after school was done me and my friends were going to head over to our house's to get dressed for the dance. After we were all dressed @PERSON1 picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly.  When we got there every body was looking dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and some brown worn out work boots. We look at him from head to toe and we thought to our self are we in a messed up hillbilly dream? That was just the beginning of what was yet to come. As every body started to get in grove of the beat we soon all started dancing to the music the music was good and every body was having a good time even the kid with the flannel. But just as every thing was going good a song came on that was called cotton eyed @CAPS1 when the flanneled kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants he soon stared kicking and swinging his feet and arms like if they had no bone or joints in them. Every body started to form a circular around the kid and every body was laughing and copying the kids movement even us. He didn't rely care he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The funnest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one and yet this kid manged to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair ofcorduroy pants this kid was out of his mind in fact we still laugh and talk about it tell this day.

 Laughter is an important part of my life, either my friends are making me laugh or i am making them laugh. One prime example is on the @DATE1 me @PERSON1 three of my closest buddy's went hunting. That trip was the bast @PERSON1 worst hunting experience of my life. it was the worst because we shot @PERSON1 missed at two bears @PERSON1 one of the biggest bucks of my life. But it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny. The trip turned out to be a failure but the most important thing was that we had a blast, @CAPS1 teen age boys ridding around in a pick up truck making each other laugh. Another example was one @DATE1 this @DATE2 me @PERSON1 two boat loads of my friends went trip to a nearby fishing hole called @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1 is a small quiet @ORGANIZATION1 that not very many people go to, it is very peaceful. I brought out my fifteen foot duck/fishing boat @PERSON1 my ten foot canoe. I was controlling the big boat the only boat with a motor @PERSON1 towing behind us was the canoe. Inside the canoe was @PERSON1, two kids that don't mean to be funny but you cant help but to laugh at them. We were having a good @DATE1 of fishing @PERSON1 it was starting to wrap up. On our way back we stopped to fix a pole @PERSON1 the slack in the rope that was pulling the canoe became slack. When we started to move again the slacked tightened @PERSON1 the canoe lurched forward unbeknown to @PERSON1, who was standing up at the time. caused him to almost fall out. @PERSON1 when i mean almost i mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet @PERSON1 his hands which were holding on to the side rail. The only part that was in the water was his butt. This turned out to be the high light of the trip @PERSON1 we still bring it up from time to time. My friends @PERSON1 i have a lot of adventures most of them turn out bad but, all of them turn out funny.

 I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories.
<START>

 As I remember back, it was @DATE1. It was a hot, humid day. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided I was going to go swimming. But the only problem was I had no one to go with me, and @CAPS2 attitude was turning for the worst. The day @CAPS1 off fairly well for the most part. I called around to all @CAPS2 friends to see what they were doing for that particular day, but as I went down @CAPS2 friend line everyone seemed to be to busy to go anywhere with me. I was most certainly bummed. @CAPS2 happy go lucky attitude turned into the dumps really fast. The only thing that was left for me to do was use @CAPS2 back up plan, @CAPS2 aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed towards @ORGANIZATION1. I was really not in the best of moods, and it seemed that everyone that was around me was turning into a grump as well. Totally bummed that all of @CAPS2 friends had ditched me and left me to hang with @CAPS2 aunt all day wasn't @CAPS2 explanation of fun, sorry enough to say, but it wasn't.  As the day went on the more I thought about @CAPS2 friends the more I got frustrated. Then finally it came to me, why let their stupidity of ditching (the best thing that had happened to them) me, ruin @CAPS2 day. I @CAPS1 laughing and having a grand time, and pretty soon, in all reality forgot why was having a bad day. When we got to our swimming hole, I looked around and noticed that everything was well. Everyone there was having fun. So I @CAPS1 to loosen up and have a good time. Jumping off rocks, making a fool of myself, laughing, and having a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying with what we had.  When I got home and I had realized what an awesome day @CAPS2 day had turned out to be, I realized that I shouldn't let @CAPS2 friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day turn around for the best. The most important lesson that I have learned from @CAPS2 experience that day, is to make the best out of each situation. Don't let crushed plans crush your self confidence. Put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh. laughter makes life better.

 Those eyes, it was like I was looking out into a warm carribean sunset with a flash of green while relaxing on the beach without a care in the world. Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lushes ruby red lips looed about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me i couldve sworn i was dreamin. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? Thats all i could think of, thats all i wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was to great to come true I couldnt find a way to bridge this gap i felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before and yet still i couldnt resist. it was like when adam was presented with the golden apple from eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. Thats when she inally spoke and said "@CAPS1 you know the answer to number three?". I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousend violins played by angels. my mouth droped and all I could say was "nope". I was a complete mook nothing more then a hoser, but then i noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with "thats an amzing cross ur wearing, what kind of gem is that in the cnter?". She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me "thank you, I like your cross too. mine has a ruby in it". I smiled back then i got a text message from my friend wth a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curiouse to what I was laughing about. When i finally finished the joke she too bursted out laughing and I finally gave myself a proper intruduction and told her my name. She was smiling fom ear to ear after the laugh we sared and she told me her name was "@CAPS2". Ah @CAPS2 surly it had to be a name given to angels. To this day I still thank my friend who gave me that joke, because if I had not made her laugh then we probably wouldnt have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other then she probably wouldnt be my girlfriend. To this day I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate see's fit to split us apart then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone.

Some say that laugh is the common language between people to people, nation to nation. If that is true, those laughters can speak all the languages around the world. In our lives, we all need laughters to be around. When they laugh, they don't just benefit themslves, but also all the people around them.There is a reslut from these people who study for phscology, they noticed that @CAPS1 don't cry because @CAPS1 are sad, @CAPS1 are sad because @CAPS1 cry. Same thing as laughing, @CAPS1 are happy because @CAPS1 laugh!I remember once, when I was in middle school, everyone in my class needed to go on the stage and do the presention. Before the presentation began, everyone was quiet, and there was nobody talking because we were all nervous. The classroom was dead quiet @CAPS1 could even hear a pen drop. I sat on my desk and did not know what to do. I was so neverous that I thought I would pass out in any second. I believed that was what my friends thought, too. Suddenly, we all heard a kid laughing! I did not know what he was laughing about, but the whole calss started to laugh! @CAPS1 could feel that the neverous situation was gone! Everyone started to talk and walk around. That helped me cliam myself down. I felt the big and heavy thing that was on my shoulder suddenly disappeared! The story was so unforgetable because I realized how aould a laughter change the situation from bad to good.Laugh could change the whole world from dangerous to peace. I am a laughter. I love to laugh because when I laugh, I feel everything is better. It could be both positive or negative, but laugh dose make my life better. People who are around me think that I am fun to be with because they could feel the joy I bring to them.Laugh is an important part of a relationship. My friend and I, when we get together, we always laugh about everything, from some random house to the sky. We really have fun together. There one time that I wondered, what is nobody in my group laugh when we are together? That would be no fun anymore! Without laughters, the distance between my friends and I would be a big gap, but with laughter, we would not have any distance between us! Then I noticed that the other group of people. Maybe they just had the bad day, they had no amile on their faces. When they sat together, nobody talked or laughed during the lunch time. They seemed they were not friends anymore. After dys, they started to talk again. They laughed just like they were good together! I realized that laugh could change everything. It could change not only the inside the relationship but also how people view your realationship.Laughters do help us out a lot. On mental, physical, and social, they benefit us in our lives.

 Laughter is an integral element to many situations. These situations vary greatly, disasters to the desire to be cheered up to simply wanting to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances no matter how grave, terrifying or uneasing. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 made me very worried for my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1 which I at the time I, and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried to the best of our ability to make light of this disaster. Our fears were made even worse when he never logged onto the ning or facebook, but we know now that was just because electricity was down for him that night (night for us). When we learned he was safe, at least for the time being we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped diffuse the situation, as it has many times before. As of now this is still a story in the making because as this is being written there are still great dangers for that region, not the least of which is the threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes are continuing into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation in a way, makes it feel less serious.  Of course many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are legitimately fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be "edgy" or "offensive". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring, they, most often, are people with with a sense of humor and a sense of distress.

One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end.

 LAUGHTER @CAPS1 knows that laughter is a healing medicine. It has the power to ease a lot of aches and pains, such as the hole in someone's heart after a breakup or the suffering of someone unable to provide for their family. However, the kind of aches laughter eased in my life was the pain from the loss of a dear friend and teacher. Recently, one of the best teachers I've gotten the chance to know passed away. He was trying to get into the @ORGANIZATION1 to set up his lesson plans for the @TIME1, when the fatal incident happened. <@NUM1</@CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and had gotten a substitute to take his place. It was six o'clock in the @TIME1 and still dark out as @PERSON2 tried to open the doors of the @ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was down on the ground waiting for someone to come help. Eventually, @PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @NUM2. The ambulance hustled to come pick him up and rushed him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was big. It took his life and they weren't able to revive him. @PERSON2 was pronounced dead on the day of @DATE1.  Our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 that @TIME1. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. The air was filled with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a bit, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim face, @PERSON3, our principle, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open and I gasped. I could hear people adjusting in their seats and murmuring among themselves as they struggled to take in the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked expressions on @CAPS1 of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't just yet. @PERSON3 explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth. I was in shock. I didn't believe that @PERSON2 was gone.  After our principle was finished speaking, we were ushered out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard sobbing, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk. People in my class filed in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for that class didn't talk to us, so we presumed we weren't doing anything. Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the @TIME1 was setting in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was drenched in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said anything, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, people stopped to hug me as I sluggishly walked down the hallway to my second period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, was the soft sound of music. Instead of crying by themselves, people were being comforted by friends. Students were making cards for @PERSON2's family. We were all reminiscing the good times we had with @PERSON2. We retold the stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crack he would get in his voice when he raised it in even the slightest way. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long day, we felt alright. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not mourn it.  The rest of the day was alright. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 years. We could remember the man @PERSON2 was through the small tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a time of need.

One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh. Why is it that we like to laugh? Laughter is every important in our lives because it brings us joy, happiness, and most of all it just fills our stomachs with butterflies. One major thing that about laughter is the whole point of view. Of course everyone makes jokes, dorky things, or simply a funny comment. All those things cause laughter, sometimes laughter helps people grow a good relationship and it builds up to be strong.  In relationships like boyfriend/girlfriend, parents with their children, family, or even friends have to have some laughter in their relationship because if not then that would be a boring relationship. At times it's hard to bring laughter in the picture but we at least need to try to laugh it is healthy for us to laugh once in a while. In families its important to grow a relationship with the child or parents and they need some funny feelings in their stomachs that make them giggly inside and its all could laughter. Friends always will have funny moments to laugh about, it's sometimes the pranks that they do to each other, the funny comments, the jokes and it's easy as that to start laughing and creating the good relationship with just laughing with each other.   Sometimes laughter could cause bad things if we use for bad things and that could cause a bad relationship. We also don't want to hurt someone's feelings by laughing at them because something that happen or if someone made a comment, because that could leave us not laughing to much after we loose a relationship with someone. The smiles that people have on their faces is a wonderful thing to see. In all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle. People have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that, well it's called laughing. I know if I was having a bad day and I felt all depressed and mushy I would like someone to make me laugh by simply saying a hilarious joke.  In my personal opinion I love laughing and especially making people around me laugh. At times I have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better. I know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over. Life is so much better if we all have laughter in them. Imagine the world with just laughter, how life would be. i wish that could happen because that would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on the faces.   In my personal life my family and friends are full of laughter. I have to make jokes at times when things are getting diffcult and everyone is freaking out. Laughter is a part of us either we like it or not it's always going to be with us no matter what. Eventually I would say that laughter is a element in my life that I will always carry and I hope that everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them because seriously it's important in this this world.

 Laughter, to me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I employ it at every chance that I receive. To many, laughter @MONTH1 be trivial, but to me, it holds the key to my relationships with other people. Without laughter, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life, might not be their because I used laughter to develop them into friendships.  Friends were hard to come by in my childhood. I did not make good choices, not with whom I associated myself with; rather, with how I approached other people for the first time. I would come off as brash, rude, or annoying, to name a few among many. I had no experience with making relationships, and the first impression is very important. Just like any meal, the first sense that is appealed to, is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, next, the aroma floats aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you must practice, and that is what I did. It was a long and arduous process, but come my sophomore year in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I began to feel like I mastered the art of making other people laugh. As students, and individuals, people come and go, we @MONTH1 truly end up forgetting their entire being, or we @MONTH1 leave an impression on their mind. I try this through laughter; to be remembered if not, only for a day. Using laughter, I acquired new opportunities to make friends, and I did not squander those opportunities. I surrounded myself in a net of laughter, I developed the necessary skills to make people laugh. I enjoyed it, and I still do. One relationship that I built, is with a young women. I had never spoken to her before, until our teacher put us into a group together. Laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone I'm not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms our generation know all to well. We would listen to the same music, and gradually, our relationship was nurtured into a stead-fast friendship. It has developed to the point were, in class, we long for each others company. We look for classes to have together because we love to make each other laugh. And because of laughter, I have made a friend with whom I share secrets, time, and moments with which I shall forever cherish. Recently she has decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would like nothing more to help her, and whomever so decides to partake in my leadership. I do not necessarily claim to be the best, but I am confident in my abilities to teach the techniques, and fundamentals of the game. Their is not much more I would like to do, that is to play the sport that I love, with the women I love. And most of the credit belongs to laughter because, when her amiable face lights up from something I said, it means all the world to me, whether she knows it, or not. I have many such connections with other people from both sexes, but none so much as hers. I worked hard to build connections with other people because they would make life that mach easier, and that much more enjoyable. In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 their are no exclusive social groups, or roving bands of football players ready to pick out the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all one community, we all belong, and that is due, in part, by laughter. Laughter connects people from around the world, it is the universal language every race, skin color, and religion all speak. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart, but in life, the medicine most prescribed, is laughter.

 People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous "they" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with "them". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE1 and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM1 months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter.

 Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the @CAPS1 and it is considered comedic. On a hot @DATE1 @TIME1, something quite similar happened to me and my friends.  I live next to the @LOCATION1. I know of this one spot on the @LOCATION1, its called @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the tree's that surround it. The @LOCATION1 is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from @NUM1 feet too @NUM2 feet. On the other side of the @LOCATION1, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive tree's behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION1 is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION1 bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings.  On this particular day, I was going to bring @CAPS2, @PERSON2, @CAPS3, and @PERSON1. My friend @CAPS2 is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home-schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about @NUM1 feet off the water. Somehow, @CAPS2 ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @CAPS6! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knee's to his to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @CAPS2 tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed strait at the water. There was what seemed like a @NUM7 second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM5 seconds later, @CAPS2 emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @PERSON2, @CAPS3, @PERSON1, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a @NUM9 yard swim to get all the way to @CAPS2. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until @PERSON1 got there. @PERSON1 is almost 6'@NUM7 and @NUM11 pounds, so he grabbed @CAPS2 around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when @CAPS3 and @PERSON2 finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @CAPS2 would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of @CAPS18 fault for pressuring him in the first place.  After almost @NUM5 hours of basking in the in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only @NUM5 @LOCATION2. We decided to explore down the @LOCATION1 a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that @CAPS2's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except @CAPS2 saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. @CAPS2 looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn'@CAPS3 hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone.  This was the first time that @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share @CAPS18 @LOCATION1 spot with all of @CAPS18 own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did. To this day we all still reminisce about that hot @DATE1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 when @CAPS2 attempted a gainer off the cliff. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five) people."

 Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing.

                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was "too tired" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like "@CAPS2 who are these boys?" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled"@CAPS4" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like "@CAPS5 great she is out here". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them "@CAPS7" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said "@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him "@CAPS9 ahead" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!

 Morose and somnolent, I woke up. I woke up to go to @LOCATION1. Going to @LOCATION1 to watch a few basketball games, I was. Although I was unable to partake in the activity because I was @CAPS1 injured in the previous week of practice. Unfortunately though, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. It was about @NUM1 o'clock when we all got onto the bus and set off to @LOCATION1. All of my friends were mirthful and talkative; but me on the other hand, I was in a lackadaisical stare. The bus ride seemed to last a whole lifetime; but in two hours we arrived at our destination. @LOCATION1 had a nice school; but we were all about to find that it sometimes resembled a ghost town. The high school seemed lifeless in comparison with other schools we had played at in the past. There was nobody around and not a soul to be heard. We all sat there patiently waiting; then, after maybe five minutes or so a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms. The boys had to wait till the girls were done playing their game; so, we all went and started shooting on one of the auxiliary courts. Although, sadly due to my injury I could not participate in the activity. They were all having so much fun screwing around down there. Just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill. After the girls game we all went to change. After that we all sat there, joking around and waiting for our coach to come in and give us our pre-game pep talk. It seemed like ages before our coach finally came into the locker room. He talked about what we should and shouldn't do in order to get the win. When the game started I was really getting depressed, but I sucked it up and cheered on my team. The first half of the game was great and we were on top. Although the second half wasn't so great. We only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin. My friends tried to be stoical; but I could tell that they were ashamed. Ashamed of their performance in the second half. This once again made me feel sad and depressed. Next, I had no choice but to go and watch two more games in the old, vulgar, and uncomfortable bleachers of @LOCATION1. The first of the two games was a great one; we won by two points. The next game on the other hand, was a very boring one. It seemed to take forever; but the worst of it was the fact that we lost. After that final game I had to wait for my cousin to come out from the locker room. When he did, we went to check out with our coaches; we had to check out in order to ride home with our parents. So off we went; but first we had to get something to eat. Once again, like all the times before we chose to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. We went through the drive through, got our food, then pulled over so we could eat. At first everything seemed right; but then my cousin noticed he didn't receive the @CAPS2 he ordered. So we went in to get the problem solved. Afterwords, we were all kind of joking about the restaurant not getting the order right; then I took a bite of my burger. It was then that I realized I had received a burger without a patty. I was really upset that @ORGANIZATION1's made such a silly mistake. So once more me and my cousin went in to the restaurant. When told what the problem was they were all just in shock. They couldn't believe what they had done. So after they all settled down they made me another burger.  Me and and the family were all having a ball about the events at the @ORGANIZATION1. It was a great trip home fillled with lots of fun and laughter; which was not what me, my cousin, or anybody else expected.So in the end of my once gloomy day, I found myself stricken with laughter.

 A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it "@CAPS6 @CAPS2" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together.

 Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to.

 Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS1 as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS3's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS2 her house. When @LOCATION1 and I stepped in my house @CAPS3 was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS2 the sight of my step dad, @PERSON1 yelling @CAPS2 my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. "I can't believe @CAPS1 just can't go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS1 would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing," @PERSON1 said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS1 can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION1 had said, "@CAPS1 don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS1 could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!" @CAPS2 that point @CAPS3 was no going back @CAPS2 what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON1 began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS6 said some words that @CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS6 began to stutter. @CAPS6 spoke, "@CAPS3 was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION1 wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON2's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand." @CAPS3 was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS6 was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS6 immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS6 didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS6 couldn't take it away. @CAPS6 wanted possession of it so @CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS6 take away her phone, but @CAPS6 took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION1 and I continued laughing @CAPS6 ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS6 could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS3 was. Sad part was @CAPS6 even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS3 was nothing to say. @CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS6 had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but i had put the story as my status on @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 had saw. I didn't mention any names besides @LOCATION1 and I's, but the fact @CAPS6 knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry.  @PERSON1 began to wonder. My sister had said @CAPS3 was no toilet paper and when @CAPS6 asked if @CAPS3 was napkins she also said, "no." @CAPS6 started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. @CAPS6 was so mad, but @CAPS2 the same time laughing really hard. @CAPS6 felt like @CAPS6 should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step dad, @PERSON1 still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @CAPS6 said, "@CAPS1 @MONTH1 think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when @CAPS1 don't have any toilet paper."

 laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship like your family, friends, or your other half. Now let me tell you why it is important, there was two weeks left of school and my family had planned out to go camping for a week. Finally school was over and as we were all saying our good byes and see you next year to all our friends. My parents came to pick us up in what my dad called an "@CAPS1" that looked like an ordinary school bus. We were now off on our way to go to our camping site.  Now you would think that going camping would be for bringing the family together and having fun. But no my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on their phones while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a "because". Finally i just decided to let it go and read until we got to our camp site. Finally we arrived and the first thing we did was unload the @CAPS1 and set everything up so we could get comfortable. The same night we were all by the toasty camp fire, and as usual my family was being entertained by there video games, cellphones or everything that they thought was needed out here in the wilderness. As i sat by the fire i gazed at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family was always going to be like this and never be a close, fun or even exciting family.  The next morning after we were all awake my parents were making breakfast, and my mom had asked me if i remembered to close the @CAPS1 door before going to sleep in my tent, and i said no i forgot knowing how my mom was she got a little mad and asked my sister to go close it. As she walked up to the door she heard noises and went inside to see what it was. Before i could even blink i saw her sprinting out of the @CAPS1 and screaming off the top of her lungs. Right behind her were a group or raccoons chasing her! My dad trying to be a hero runs towards them trying to scare them off, but fails and gets bit on his butt.  Luckily my dad was @CAPS5 but while we were all distracted the raccoons had left with our food. My dad was so mad that he kicked the only log that kept the @CAPS1 from rolling away. And it starts moving right away, we all watch it go down the hill until it rode into a lake. Slowly it started to disappear once it was completely out of sight we all went to the lake staring at the large lake that devoured out @CAPS1 wondering what we were going to do with no vehicle. As we were heading back to the camp site all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. not paying attention of whats in front of them my mom fell in to a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped in too. Once they got out they looked so outraged and looked as if they were ready to call out mother nature to a fight.  Once we made it back to the camp site we sat down and i took a good look at each one of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered with mud, we were all hungry and not really in the best mood. I sat there and said dad don't get even more mad but but i thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt, and i showed him the picture i took when it happened. My family then all looked at it and started laughing and laughing we all suddenly started talking and actually acting like a family! We decided to just walk home and hitch hike, we walked down the road for a good hour until we got a ride from a local trucker we saw down the road. Once we got home we talked more, we spent more time together we were really like the perfect family i wished i could have. That camping trip changed us all and I'm happy that it did because now me and my family are closer than ever! And that's how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship.

Sometime ago on a hot @DATE1 day my @NUM1 ,@PERSON3 ,@PERSON1, @PERSON4 ,and @PERSON2. Wanted to do something that could give us relief from the extream heat. So we sat down and talked to find out what we could do and were we wanted to go. So @PERSON7 had a few ideas one was go over to @LOCATION3 house were there was an air conditioning his other idea was to walk @NUM2 miles to @CAPS1 swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there,really know one hates @CAPS1 but no body wanted to walk that far in the heat ,then walk back to @CAPS3 @NUM3 had three ideas number one of his ideas was walk to his uncles house @NUM4 miles away to see if we could catch a ride to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, his second idea was to go down to our friends @PERSON5's house and go swim in his built in pool, his third idea was to to go in the back yard i spray our selves with the hose. @PERSON1 had two ideas one was to see if he could get his mom to lend him some money to fill his tank and to pay her back,his other idea was to drive to the coast and camp there for a few days if he got the money from his mom.Byran had three ghetto ideas one was to go jump in the water fountain by the @ORGANIZATION1 then quickly get out before we got in trouble, second idea was to go over to the @LOCATION4...A.K.A. the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and hop over the fence and then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go over to the old people homes and swim in there pool there because he said he knew a @NUM5 had three ideas one was to walk a mile to to the forks , second was to walk down to the creek @NUM4 miles away third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them threw out @CAPS3 room. I was with @PERSON1 on his ideas pf going to the coast and camping and what not because i love to camp at the beach it smells all pretty most of the time there is really fine chicks so yeah i was way down to go to the coast for real.So we sat and we waited and waited and waited for @PERSON1's mom to call us finally his phone rings we were all excited but it was just his grandma calling him we were bummed all hell. so there we were once again waiting for what seem to be for ever for a phone call by @ORGANIZATION3's @NUM7 phone ring we didn't have hopes up this time we figured it was some one else but guess what this time it actually was @PERSON1's mom she said that she'll lend him the money but us boys had to do something for her she wanted us to go down to the bimor and pick @CAPS9 from work then buy her some cigars for @PERSON1's grandpa so we did.After were done the earn run we packed our clothes,blankets,sleeping bag,food,camping supplies, and wood.After a good hour it was @NUM4 @CAPS10.M. we went to the chevron and fueled @PERSON1 tank then we were off to @ORGANIZATION2 city @LOCATION1 the drive to almost two hours it seemed but what a beautiful ride long tunnels beautiful river , mountains oh and who could forget the beautiful tall red woods of @LOCATION1 and the smell of that forest you can smell it through almost any car.I thought it was funny when we got close to the coast the temperature dropped like @NUM9 degrees @CAPS11 and ever-body was in a good mood and could smell the coastal air.When we got to the camp site we ran out to the beach as jumped in people look at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like @NUM10 feet out in @NUM9 degree water it was funny because people wouldn't stop talking but then we found out we were swimming a red zone were there has been rip tide advisories so after that we were really @LOCATION2 and we realizes we had no propane so we had to go into to town and get propane for our stove so we did then we ate the best hot dogs ever dipped in @ORGANIZATION4 honey it was delicious.We stayed at the coast for a night then @PERSON6 got called in to go to work so we had to leave and go back to the heat in @CAPS12 @CAPS6 @CAPS13 it was a way way big drag and it was so hot getting back we pretty upset at the weather but when we got back @CAPS3 mom wanted to go out to the river so in the end it was all good.

 In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said "Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share." @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was "@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh." @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class."@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say " @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it." That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 "@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner." I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever.

 I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and nicks mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a life time.  If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when i say hours i mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good time just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst." I just cant do this long distance thing anymore" said @PERSON2." @CAPS2? @CAPS2 cant we just work things out?" i said with tears starting to come out."" @CAPS3 it just isn't far to us." @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice." @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had." @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that far to us?" @PERSON2 Said." @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing it to bad for us. hehe" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. " @CAPS7 now i know i need you." he said laughing in the back ground.After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it vary hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and i thank god that it was.Even to this vary day, i can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together.Laughter can keep two people that leave from a far together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together?For a day?A year?Three years?Or maybe a whole life time?Only time could tell.

When you laugh, is @CAPS5 out of habit, or is @CAPS1 cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS1 even such a thing as a "cause" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE1, @CAPS3 older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS3 sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS1 was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS3 body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS3 seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS5 shut once @CAPS3 body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS3 surprise, @CAPS5 was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS5 open obnoxiously yelling, "I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!" @CAPS1 was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, "@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!" and " I can't believe she said that!" or "...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says..."@CAPS5 was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room locatated at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman-year-of-high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, "@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!" @CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @CAPS1 sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered @CAPS5 and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, @CAPS1 was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, "@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?" @CAPS8 in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of @CAPS3 mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends.

                               Trippin' on fences I am @NUM1 years young, and in those short @NUM1 years, all I can ever remember, is laughing hysterically. Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. "Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS1 can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It @MONTH1 seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those "@CAPS1 had to be there" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS1 don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if @CAPS1 laugh at just the smallest things in life. That's why to me anyways, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people".

 Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are usually better if both the people are happy. Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing. When I was born, my mother said that I was the most chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult. I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together. I was taught by my mother, who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears, to laugh at every chance I had. Through my years as an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way to adolescence. As I moved into adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, a mild autistic @CAPS1 that has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 develop cases where their emotions do not show physically. This case is similar to the physical features of @CAPS3 @CAPS1. My main case with having @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 is that I do not receive all the information given to me at one time. When people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everybody around me is laughing, but I am standing there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I cannot laugh. Though I say this, I know it is not true. I can laugh, it is just really hard for me to find the right time. Most times, I laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face. This usually makes me feel embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me I look expressionless and then try to perk me up, or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in happy times in my life. I have not laughed enough, but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones. Learning that at any moment I can laugh is important. Even if there is no joke being told, I can laugh. Most people would probably look a me in a weird way, but I wouldn't care because I am the one that feels happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes other people feel good, and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in. I have finally learned that even with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, I can laugh just as much as anyone.
