Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benefit us in many ways like talking and becoming friends will others through websites like facebook and mysace. Using computers can help us find coordibates, locations, and able ourselfs to millions of information. Also computers will benefit us by helping with jobs as in planning a house plan and typing a @NUM1 page report for one of our jobs in less than writing it. Now lets go into the wonder world of technology. Using a computer will help us in life by talking or making friends on line. Many people have myspace, facebooks, aim, these all benefit us by having conversations with one another. Many people believe computers are bad but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them? I am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only school work but my social life and how I make friends. Computers help us with finding our locations, coordibates and millions of information online. If we didn't go on the internet a lot we wouldn't know how to go onto websites that @MONTH1 help us with locations and coordinates like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be in @LOCATION3. When your supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2. Million of information is found on the internet. You can as almost every question and a computer will have it. Would you rather easily draw up a house plan on the computers or take @NUM1 hours doing one by hand with ugly erazer marks all over it, you are garrenteed that to find a job with a drawing like that. Also when appling for a job many workers must write very long papers like a @NUM3 word essay on why this job fits you the most, and many people I know don't like writing @NUM3 words non-stopp for hours when it could take them I hav an a computer. That is why computers we needed a lot now adays. I hope this essay has impacted your descion on computers because they are great machines to work with. The other day I showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention sense sliced bread! Now go out and buy a computer to help you chat online with friends, find locations and millions of information on one click of the button and help your self with getting a job with neat, prepared, printed work that your boss will love.

Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Others have different ideas. A great amount in the world today are using computers, some for work and spme for the fun of it. Computers is one of mans greatest accomplishments. Computers are helpful in so many ways, @CAPS4, news, and live streams. Don't get me wrong way to much people spend time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others but who are we to tell them what to do. When I grow up I want to be a author or a journalist and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on time on the computer, one @MONTH1 spend more time then the other but you know exactly what @CAPS5 getting at. So what if some expert think people are spending to much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying natures and interacting with family and friends. For all the expert knows that its how must people make a living and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time and to be honest it's non of my concern and it shouldn't be the so called experts concern. People interact a thousand times a day on the computers. Computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers helps the @ORGANIZATION1 locate most wanted criminals. As you can see computers are more useful to society then you think, computers benefit society.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail "@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said "@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is." @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there.

Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very conveint. Computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. An other reason why the computers are good for society is educations. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find the out, but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to collage. If you arn't up to going to school/collage because your sick. You wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computors so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could lean about different countries far away. As a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convience. Now a say the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente, subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have acess to a camputer daily in america.. @NUM1 and how many people go on at least an hour a @NUM2. That means that @NUM3 people cant exercise are wasting many are have the posibility of physical @CAPS1 that sound good to you? Think of everything you done when you write a letter. I got up and got all the materials and sit back down. After In done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? @CAPS2 instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in him/er. Did you know that you can literally but from on your computer. Instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer, to long. @NUM4 thing is that when you at a computer @CAPS2 what happened to my grandpa is that when you are in a wood chair all day you can get ardthritis in your muscle @CAPS3 thing th.

Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, @CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. @CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, @CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel @CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.
<START>

@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there." said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!"

Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and "boom," instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, "@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future.
<START>

In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues. As people become more intune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing, but watch television are often refered to as cauch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addition itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do take away from peoples life and aren’t as important than the other factors of life. First of all you know that the world is becoming obease because of lack of exercise. Also people don't realize that @CAPS3 warming is becomeing a big problum. Finally familys arn't as close as they used to be. these are all the reasons why computers arn't important to human socioty. First of the world is becomeing obease and cumputers play a huge part in this. Computers don't make people exercise they basicly just sit down on there couch and use the computer this won't help amarica get back into shape. Also computers become a habbit if a person uses a computer everyday of there life it will become an addiction then they won't be able to stop. Finally when people use the computer they don't realize the lack exersise there getting. This is the first reason why computeres are a bad thing. Next @CAPS3 warming is mealting the polar ice caps. Computers play a part in @CAPS3 warming because they use electricty and thjen the electrisity melts the polar ice caps. If this keeps happining then they will all melt and we will not have a shorline and half of the world will be fluded. Finally computers play a huge part in @CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so popular. This is another reason why computers are bad. Finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life. For instance there are more and more familys splitting up now and sientest sat that @PERCENT1 of the time it's because of technolagy. When on peroson is on the computer the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselfs. Then they split up for good. This is the last reason why I feel computers are bad. In conclution you can see that computeres are a bad thing. First of all you can see that amarica is becomeing obease because of the computers. Also computers are causeing @CAPS3 warming and are eventually goung to flood the earth. And last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy. These are all the reasons why computers are bad.

Dear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.

Dear, In this world today we should have everyone useing computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge. everything you need to know is in a computer. You can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you. Computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them. Today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them. There are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @CAPS1, and facebook ect. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures. Thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people. Everyone should have a computer in there home today.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, "@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands." @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerance people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Oviously, computers are a useful aid in todays era. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?

Dear Local Newspaper, I belive that computers have a negative effect on peoples lives. I belive this because who spend to much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is I belive that people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exersise and that is very unhealthy. Instead of watching the games or the scores they should get out and play the game. I also belive that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beauty of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privalges would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out, which boost your social skills and the computer can't always do that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addictted to it. The computer @MONTH1 have lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a reason why we should get off the computer. There are pleanty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including sports, taking care of family, and any of your hobbys. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I belive that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the the computer can't do everything.

Dear Local Newspaper, I must admit that the experts are centainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day and that’s really not good if you ask me. Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much more better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 be, you get board, and hungry, and I know theres some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat. There are many ways you can exercise. You can take walks, you can go joggin, you could play a sport, I mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer. I know some people that could be workin all day and still come home to there computer. Rest is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer, you could just relax watch a movie, eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself, you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but thats not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your gonna have when you leave, and come back home too something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if your really into computers, try to balance your time out.

Well computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don'@CAPS1 realy see @CAPS2 computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know @CAPS2 computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers has positive effects on people like me. Computers teaches hand-eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out reasearch for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, desiner @CAPS1-shirts, logos, banners and lots of other creative things. With computer you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores @CAPS2 cool is that!! Well im a regular person not rich not famous but computers provide lot of information people use today. Thats why I think that computers has a positive effects on people and you don'@CAPS1 have to be super smart to use one.

Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today. Each day new discoverys are made from the people that use computers in our society, however many people say that computers are harmful to are communtiy. Today I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are. To begin with discoverys in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day new discoverys are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for dieseases would have never been discovered and more people. Would have died. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household neccessitys, and many more objects. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. So you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social networks like twitter, myspace, facebook, and youtube you will always have something to do. During this economic recestion it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast. Many people also speed up their word by using the computer. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me.

Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1 a take all your computer and given to the people around the world for the can stay in their houses chating with their family and friend. Computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you ever see a child on the computer for hours and nothing could get them off? Well I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exersice, interact face to face with people or use their minds to the best of their @NUM1. The more and more we advance in society we get laziar and forget to about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them. Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exersice once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this, @PERCENT1 of kids. Thats more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the and compared it in @CAPS3 children who don't the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exersice only once a week. That's for less what these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 @PERCENT2 of children are overweight and @PERCENT3 of them develope heart of blood problems as adults. I by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike, or go for a jog. It doesn't sound hard does it? If we make a to spend this than on computers I think we can reduce this obesity amount and I believe @CAPS2 ran as on overall country. On the computer we have popular websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. More websites allow you interact with people over the island. This could be in more ways than one. These computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them. With this personal info, could and with these websites the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these websites cause people to their social skills. People spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. This creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicides and because of computers and I believe with less of them people would spend more time with their family and or nation would be closer and safer. Computers dont allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make it easy and I myself, think it makes me laziar because it allow me to read a book there or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution. There's years and I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing them and not realize it at all. Without them, would make a difference. Kids are living through computers and we can change them.

Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! "On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. "The internet gives us access to the world," says @PERSON1, "we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment." @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. As you can see. computers don't just "your barain," they imprdove hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. The computer @MONTH1 be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and @MONTH1 do serious damage to their brain. Although, I believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer makings or program designing. Some kids @MONTH1 have their education online or to teach others. The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. Many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them.
<START>

Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember @CAPS4 my older sister had to do some research on @CAPS1, the computer gave her all of the information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that @CAPS2 does benifit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that @CAPS2 allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. "@CAPS2's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do @CAPS2 from the computer then @CAPS2 gets done so much faster!" @CAPS3 @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. @CAPS2 is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember @CAPS4 my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! "@CAPS4 im bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on @CAPS5.com," @CAPS3 my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! @CAPS2's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through.

Computers a good because you can get infermation, you can play games, you can get pictures, But when you on the computer you might find something or someone that is bad or is viris. If ther is a vris you might want shut off the computers so it does not get worse. The are websites for kids, like games, there are teen games, there are adult games. Also pictures are bad for kids because most of the time they lead to inapropreit pictures. You should only look up infermation that you need not things like wepons or knifes. Also there are differnt kinds of companies like @CAPS1&t @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is a good place to get computers @CAPS1 so is @CAPS1&t.

Dear Newspaper, Computers are high tec and have expanded in an everyday thing. They play a big role in society. Computers have been improved to do many different things without them we would barely get any thing done. Although kids should start goind outside more, computers teaches kids new things, and it is useful. With computers kids are rarely going outside. A lot of our population of the @LOCATION1 are obese, including kids. Because of this they are staying inside and on their computer. Kids need to go outside evry once and while to get some fresh air and exercise. If they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child. Since computers are rapidly growing and adapting kids spend half of the day on it just stareing at the screen playing some flash game, like run escape. Instead of wasteing their time doing that they should go outside, take a walk just do something! Computers teaches kids new things. Google something like trees. You would get bunch of websites containg information about trees. Kids also play games, if they don't know it, some of the games they play are teaching them stuff, for an example, my little sister, goes on a site called nickeloden.com I see that right and it teaches her stuff she didn't know before. from those types of games it prepared her for kindergarden. Now a days more and more sites keep adapting and becoming known like bing. Computers are real useful. suppose you want to know whats goind on at work. So click your mouse on internet explorer and get your email. With computers, you could go on social networking sites, like facebook and connect with friends. You can also go on instant messageing site to talk to friends and see what there up to. For your entertainment you could play games. Remember though to not stay on too long. Computers are big deal in our community. Life would be very difficult without them. But remember not to stay on too long! Although kids should start going outside, computers, teaches kids new things, and is useful.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people throughout the world use, or own computers. Although there are @CAPS1 people who think computers are good for you, others could say different. While you are on the computer you can become more socal by talking with friends or family. Also, while you are on the computer you @MONTH1 not notice it but; your hand-eye coordination is improving, and finally, you are able to search with a click of a button, instead of searching your topic through dozens of books. Computers have very @CAPS1 benefits. One being chating, or talking online to friends, and family. You @MONTH1 have a distant friend that you haven't talked to in a while. With a computre you are able to re connect with your buddy. If you have an acount that is safe to chat on, you @MONTH1 be able to make new friends. That would be good for you, socally. It is always good to have friends, and stay in touch with family. Some people find it hard to play a piano because they cannot look at the music and have their hands be doing something else. On a computre your hand-eye-coordination improves over time because, you are searching a topic as your hands are typing. Also, this is a great memory excirsise for your fingers. You eventually memorize where all of the keys are located. People without computres have to search through @CAPS1 books to find information on their topic. Others with computers, just have to type in their topic and all the information they need is right infront of them. You are able to see pictures of your topic or even video's! Not @CAPS1 books that I know, can search a topic, show you pictures, and videos of it with one resource! @CAPS1 people debate the fact if computres are good for you or not. If you ask me, computres are great for people. It allows people to be socal, and talk to old friends; it also improves your hand-eye coordination, and finally; it gives you the option to search a topic without all the hastle of searching through dozens of books. So now the question is up to you; are computers good for people, or not?
<START>

Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society.
<START>

I agree that computers deffinately are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. "@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. "@CAPS6, please friend request me", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. "@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!" I said. "@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty," says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me "@CAPS3's up?" or "@CAPS4 was your day?" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?
<START>

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 I think the effects that computers do on people are really positive. Computers can be used for all sorts of things. Examples like finding things out about history. People that changed the world and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn. For example, their are lots of websites that offer online tutoring or good ways to help you pass school. Other positive way is online dateing sites. You can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most that I think thats the best in my opinion is going to school online. Once your done with colloge and you are a nuse, for an example you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse then being a @ORGANIZATION2. I think computers has a positive effect on people.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negitive affect in a childs life. I disagree. A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kids don't don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homeworks, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games. Theres even a to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a students interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 grater. This is where a computer can have aim, facebook, and even myspace help a kid impact with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unseatled. A computer also new friends from other towns. Teens need to and make new friesnd will helps as in life. If a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help. Every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils. you can stay home, have money and typee the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing can be a hastle and messy, so it saves time and the mess. If @CAPS1 are words you dont understandd then you can look them out. Computers are and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as uss. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technology we have @DATE1.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Where would we be without them? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. Obviously, computers are beneficial. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, as I said earlier. I know people say that where you are on be computer, you spend less time exercising, but the computers help you with you throwing skills. Hand ey coordination also applies for if you want to be a surgeon/doctor. You need to have steady hands. What we ready to do whatever is needed. See, they do have a positive effect. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet. Say you want to be an engineer when you grow up, you might want to learn anything and everything you can to be successful later on in that carer. What about a doctor, you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree. A computer helps you learn about those things. It can also teach you about tons of other things. Again, how could they not be positive. I think computers have a positive effect on people. Another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away. Mail can so my where with enough, yes, but @CAPS3-mail is free and gets there in less than a minutes where mail can lake weeks to go far. For example, what if you came from another country. You wouldn't want to lose touch with people you grew-up with. With a computer, you could use skype to see now new the person. Talking on the phone or mailing doesn't even compare to that. You could never lose touch! Computers help people do all kinds of things. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. There are no bad reason that could top any of these. They make sense. So, what do you think? Do you think they are good for us, or do we need less computers?

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even "A" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these "exports" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one.

Dear local Newspaper A lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better excercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!

Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to naylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use skpye because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping-pong. It help me wacth the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. These are the reasons why I belive computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology. Technology keeps on upgrading.
<START>

I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers. People needs computers to look for a job. Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer. Studys show taht @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.

The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad couse you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click. Computers save time and does a lot of work. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best.

People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends. People spened to much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired every easy. First of all people spend to much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites. People spend way to long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for test. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework to. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework. Kids should get off the computer and worry about school. My final reason, kids get tired from being on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of kids get so tired they can't do anything once they get off the computer. I got so tired from being on the computer for so long I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget they made plans after school. One kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends. Kids need to get away from the computer. In conclusion, kids spend to much time on computers. People spend to much time on computer. Kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer. Aslo, kids get tired very quickly from being on the computer. Something has to be done about this.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it computers @CAPS1 help you. You can't always gain wait by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can defenetly still talk with kids, friends, and family members on computer. @CAPS1 you no if books have all the information you need for school project, or your own family history. Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heros. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computer are the reasons why we no our history and know about actors, slaves, sergents, and much more. Have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long. I haven't gain a pound or an ounce since I've been on computer. Not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How @CAPS1 you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things? Or if the person is eating while being on the computer. @CAPS1 you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call? Why @CAPS1 you think we have enternet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more. Most of my family members life in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2 and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price. So what @CAPS1 you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer. Or get bad grades for doing the bad research. Its you chooce, choose now if either talk with family and friends on phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for how long you want and still get the same bill price.

Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is needed because it helps you with information, it helps you to become smarter and it helps you with hand-eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason. My first reason I'll like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place's, people, culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information. My second reason I'll like to state that will convince you with. The time we spend on computer's are needed is it helps us to become smarter. Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it. Computers make you become become smarter. And at the end of the day it's about who's smarter not who does more excerise. My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand-eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay's and when you have good hand-eye coordination you dont make a lot of mistake's typing. So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information, you become smarter, and it teaches good hand-eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed. A lot of computer time is needed because you get smarter plus it beneifts society.

Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way.

Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. "They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye." my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?

Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?

Computers are the greatest tool mankind has. They give people acsess to more information than anything else in the world. they ler us connect faraway places with one click of the button without computers people would never know and learn or do as much as can without computers modern planes or cars would not exist. without computer this very test probaly would not exist so no sconclusion to much time on the computor, because theres more to do than one can doin lifetime

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere and you didn't have a map or @CAPS1 near you and the only thing that was the near you was a @CAPS3. Well I am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go. Computers are very helpful in every one's daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them, @CAPS2 about again trying to figure out were someone lives it's very easy, go on google and type in someones's adress and there you go. The @CAPS3 is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you havent seen them in like a really long time and you miss them well no problem mostley all computers have some sort of camera in them were you could video chat or just chat regular on the enternet. That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it's better to do it online because how about if you havent seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email. It is so much better then mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better.. The @CAPS3 is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go some were and you dont know what the weather is going to be well you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many communications and you cant really see because they move the weather days fast. On the @CAPS3 you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it's to dark. The @CAPS3 is so helpful. People do say that it is good to get off the @CAPS3 and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping. Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you dont want to go to the mall a half hour away from were you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you dont even have to lift a fingure. They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it were if you dont know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is, also the computers have pictures of everything, if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you. with all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe.

Dear @CAPS1 of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you @CAPS2 beleive that people using computers is a very good idea. They beleive this because computers make you really focus and pay attention. This gives you really great eye sight and amazing hand eye cordonation. A important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live. The reason people would probobility want to visit one of these places on a website would probobility be for vacational purposes. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is. There is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online. IAM, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 exc. These are all great uses for computers. Also people who own a well paying email system on these computer that tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinary, or anything that involves buisness ethics. Now you know my three very important reasons to why computers are a great way to get hand eye cordonation. A great way to learn about other states. And so you can talk to friends and have a email for buisness purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over. They can show the other side of they story that they didn't say in the book. your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering. For instance if people are on a lot @PERCENT1 of the time is research. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 "I have a computer not for friends, but for work". This shows that even large important still use it for work. people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer. None the less, the computers are at their begining and they will further improve. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers. Then you will try to stop them with "computers eat your brain". We all know that is garbage. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I @CAPS3 that if people want to use computer they can. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advanement.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1! I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, "weight watchers diet plan". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy.

ARE YOU @CAPS1!! Computers are great, they're great because of these @NUM1 reasons. Kids can do homework on computers, also you could video chat with friends and family finally because you could look up just about anything you want on the computer. Computers are great because kids can do there homework on the computer, thats good because if they forgot there book in school or something like that then they could just get the answers of the computer. Its also good for business men because they count on computers for all there files. Computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family. Video chatins is awesome because if a friend or relative goes out of town they could just brings there labtop of webcam and then you can talk to them whenever. Video chatins is also good for company's if there buyer is in a different country they could just video chat all the information.Finally, computers are great because they are so resourceful. There are hundreds of websites where all you have to do is type in what you want to know and there will be thousands of links for you to search and get your answer. They ere also resourceful for pictures or maybe even powerpoint presentation! In conclusion, computers are great because, kids can get there homework done, also its good for video chat finally because the internet is very resourceful.

Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately @PERCENT1. All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and e-mail, the most commonly used cite. Without having access to a computer and its contents residents have a difficult time embarking themselves within the rest of society. For school events, sport schedules, and keeping in touch with far away family and friends. Computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society, and the way this generation has decided to start our lives. Paretns and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are nit interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a persons life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example if you are doing a project for school. the internet will provide you with any information you need. It is truely astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person in possesion of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately the benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications of which allow you to graph information design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant to sources scattered throughout the date bases on computers and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on aperson and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have to positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life.

in @DATE1 has become far more advanced. Computers are one of the most futiristic objects. The computer is good for connecting to people around the world. However, computers have bad effects on people's lives. Children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. School is very important and valuable if you want to suceed in life. However, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrat on their homework. This is a horrible habbit and a bad effect on students every where. Students grades will suffer and will not obtain class credits if this problem is not mentioned. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1, five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese. This can lead to death. The problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. Most of that time can be used to exercise. Exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life. If this problem is not addressed millions of americans will be overweight, @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous topic. Every month dozend of kids are kidnapped. Since the internet was invented there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids missing children will go on poppular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and twitter and give out their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children in to giving their address. This problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. Everyday, more and more people use computers. Compuers have good and bad effects on peoples lives. The bad effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer?

Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you about the debate that you are having asking if people should use computers. The article stated "more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society." I think people should not use computers. Also technolgy needs to slow down, it's getting to advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is, you don't want to always say to your on your honeymoon "we could to @LOCATION1 from our computer. And your life will go by fast and you want notice it, your all fat and old. Also @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are over weight because they don't exercis. Secondly the more technology there is, we are going to have less. In addition it feels better when you work and not just sit on your computer, getting a mounthly cheak. In conclusion you live a happier life when explore the. In @PERCENT2 of people who use computer commit suicide. Also if it was or to me I would the use of computers. Bead all the about computers and you will think but like me. I use to be a computer geek.
<START>

You @MONTH1 find this hard to beleive, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I, agree that computers are benefits society. The computers have positive effect on people like hand-eye coordination. I helps you learn about other country religios, and other thing. You can communicate, meet other people, and chat tru computers. Another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast. In other words is that computer help a lot of people.

Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer.
<START>

I think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @NUM1 each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family. YEah sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about. Chantrail @CAPS1 a @NUM2 grade student says "only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers. If you want to learn something new or meet new people then I suggest you stop eating those chips, get off that couch and use the computer.

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. They are good because you can learn things educational. You can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. Computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @CAPS1 you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. These are some internet sources that are @NUM1 to answer questions. @CAPS1 we didnt have computers, then @CAPS1 you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. You can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. With computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. With Computers, you can also keep information down. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. You can also make graphs on the computer. This way your graphs will nice have alright time and @CAPS1 you would to go information that in a @CAPS1 there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. I believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. I believe computers positive effect in people.

Dear news paper I think computers good for you because you can use the internet and myspace and videos and some school work like math and essays so yes I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kind of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defyntly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look those @NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read @NUM3 helps you write and spell thats one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read @NUM3 and I love doing read @NUM3 a lot and I like the read @NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by forsing my self forward to read. That's how I'll first learned how to read by computers and putting forse to my self. That's why computers is more important to me and look words up.

Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be excercising, and interacting with friends and family. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 people should be out getting exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the coubtries with the most overweight people. Many teenagers are inside all @DATE1 at the computer waiting for their friends screename to pop up so they can talk to them. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend they could be exercising. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the excercise they need for the @DATE1. They also could do ten pushups and twenty curlups, or even more if they wanted to. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 exercise. Having a computer effects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face converstions with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead. If they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life. Instead of videochatting with your cousins in another state, lan for them to come visit you guys one @DATE1. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing to. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc. It is much more fun to be with someone in real life, then to talk with them online. The last but deffidently not least effect that computers have on peoples lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends, it's pretty hard to stop. Many people don't know how to stop so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the @DATE1, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and a on the computer at the same time, the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer effects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it "stops" you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family and it distracts many kids from school.

Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?

Do you think computers effect people's society? Computers help people of age first, computers let you chat with friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. First computer is a great way to chat with friend that you havent spoke to in a long time. Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run. Finally the computer technologies is outstanding cause it allows you to chat with family memebers across state through video chat or even websites such as myspace, facebook and twitter. Secondly, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn history about famous people places and events. That why I think the computer technologie is so outstanding what you think will happen if we didnt have today? Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. Also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation. Finally, the technologie is here for a reason so we should use it for anything like getting up with friends or jus going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. In conclusion, I just told you why computer technologie is good to have. First, it lets you friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. Now I just told you why @ORGANIZATION1 technologie is a good thing to have. I hope agree with my point of view.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying "manually". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.
<START>

Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. without the guidance from @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, @CAPS6 woudn't be possible for me to reach my full potential a assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2 tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many business rely on the work of Computers entirely. In facts, @CAPS8 to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business "@LOCATION1," In our job, we continuously we work with. this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer. "@CAPS6 business and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, why change anything? We should continue to progress in this groth @PERCENT1 of business in @LOCATION1 say they would have to close dawn @CAPS6 not for computers with so many business doing this, our economy would drop. This would not help. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments. What you @MONTH1 not now, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about @LOCATION2. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search "@CAPS11 of @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2" @CAPS12 seconds, you would have your information. People @MONTH1 not believe so, but it is true that you canlearn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever reed right at your fingertips. Computer supply so much more then just entertainment. All reasonable people would agree advances in technology are extremely helpul to the public. there is so much guidance for our daily lines through computers.

Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computers scientist have found cures for desesse, jobs have become easier . I believe that computers have a baseline effect on people. Because they educate people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to people having to pay for anything. If someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do @CAPS1 go to a website that could help them find affordable . If a child @CAPS1 doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about about places all over the world, you can go on a website that has videos and written sheet clips about what has been goin on around the world and learn about current events. My grandmother would tell me stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before they had computers, now my dad works on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and he tells me stories about his day. when you compair the two different decades it saids like computers help out a lot within @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer. I think the computers have helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money. When you just want to see someone I'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. If you want to see a friend for her @CAPS9 but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up and now computers can be as big as a flat @CAPS10 and can turn them on with just a push on a button,, Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?

Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. "@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education." said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This shows that Computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @CAPS2, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these @CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. "@PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis." said @PERSON1, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one @MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do.

Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, "@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1" goes the floor. "@CAPS4 oh here comes pete." "@CAPS5, is he getting fat". "all he does is play on the computer all day long." @CAPS6 is on increasing amount or teenagers throught the @LOCATION1 who are playing on the computer too much. This is needs to stop. "@CAPS7 playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time." @CAPS8 @PERSON1 of the international health committee. @CAPS6 are always going to be obesse people around the world but in the past @NUM1 years @LOCATION2 has doubled the amount of obese @CAPS7 in all of @LOCATION3." @CAPS9 show that over @PERCENT1 of the american population is obese and very much so. The future of american is all obese lazy @CAPS7 who only want to sit down in front of a screen all day. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS7 who don't experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they play on the computers all day they don't ever use nature, they won't care for it and litter and pollute even more. Just @CAPS7 playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment like it is bad for themselves. Not only do the computers hurt the @CAPS7 and the environment it hurts the family and friend, @CAPS7 who are on the computer all day aren't spending enough time with their family and friends families are supposed to be close and they can't be if someone is playing on the computer all day. Just a couple of weeks ago @PERSON2 rayfield @CAPS8 that he got grounded because he was playing on the computer so much he didn't talk to his many in two weeks. @PERCENT3 of people who get divorced happen because of the arguements over the amount of time spent on the computer. "@CAPS8 @PERSON3 from the yale marriage research center. If @CAPS7 knew that they might cause their parents to diverse they might stop playing on the computer so much. Therefore @CAPS7 shouldn't spend that amount of time on their computer because of the health, the environment, and their families. So its up to the people really, do you want a nice physically fit nation where every family is close or and rundown obese hole in the wall that is "called" the @LOCATION4

I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e-mails to talk. That way they wont lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail. Also, because, thru an mail takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that, computers has games kids play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching t.v. don't help. If they acutually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. They can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are good use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Turst me!

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benifits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creater of new ideas or just working at the new companies retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make easier to run and make them more efficent. With the advances in technology average people can be updated on the new around the world every minute. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, fill them out and pay on line. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through todays new technology, peoples lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more arrands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news. Technology is benifiting society and will hopefully continue making life easier.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, "@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet." @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, "I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family." I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated.

Dear Newspaper, In @DATE1's world we are dependent on computers. @DATE1 computers have become the most helpful source of technology. We need computers for so many things, and they benefit society. They can help people talk online, they're educational, and they improve hand eye cordination. It has been amazing how computers help us so much. We need computers like we need water. If we didn't how would we survive? Computers have become the glue to friendships. They help keep friendships when you don't see the friend constantly. I have a friend that moved to @LOCATION1 last year. It was way too expensive to just call ot text her. So as a result, I keep in contact with her through the computer. Everyday we @CAPS1 and use skype to keep intouch. Those cost @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her each call would cost @MONEY2. if it weren't for the internet I seriously know that our friendship would collapse. Computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem. Computers have become the number one source to find information. They have become more popular than the library and text books combined. So many essential resources are on computers. Text books, calculators, and even homework are online. Many people say that computers aren't educational, but scientists say it can move a students grade from a @CAPS2- to an A+. Teachers say the same thing too. one of my fellow students said that computers changed his life. He used to be forgetting to write down his homework, but he looks online and he has all of it. Now he knows what pages to read from the science book. If you don't think that computers have changed students lives, well think again. There are also games that improves hand eye cordination. Many sports teams like the @CAPS3 use this. It has increased there hand eye cordination by @PERCENT1. the team says if it wasn't for the hand eye cordination game, then they would have never have won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. this game is also free online for anyone to use. Everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time. The games are also fun and non violent. They have games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has made a great improvement on people's lives. If we don't have computers then our hand eye cordination will decrease by @PERCENT2. would you want to be the person to take away computers? In conclusions computers have made a great impact on @DATE1's society. Computers are educational, you get to talk to friends, and improve your hand eye cordination. Computers have made a big improvement on how we live, and it's for the better. If we didn't have computers then friendships would break, grades would decrease, and hand eye cordination would plummit. We need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe. Many people depend on computers. So if we take away computers then you'll be letting many lives down. No sane person would want to take away computers. Computers have benifited society in so many ways.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for using "too much" computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas. Such as as exercise, socialize with family and friends, and lastly, "you time" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 computers. For excersice you can do any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending time with family and friends you can have a nice family reunion at their house @CAPS5 just "hangout with your friends. Four "you time you can draw, @CAPS5 read a book. Their is a lot of ideas instead of "computer time @CAPS6 the time!" With exercising can go outside and play sport such as basketball, soccer @CAPS5 baseball, etc. You could even play hide and seek with your friends @CAPS5 even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house ins tead of using computers! If you exercise everyday such as "workout" to get fit you will definatelly manage that instead of using "computer time". Exercising is a good idea ins tead of using "computer time!" @CAPS3 with family and friends is a good use instead of "computer time because you can finally have the time to spend time with then like talk to them, play games @CAPS5 eat dinner together. That's called "@CAPS3" Your family @CAPS5 friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner together and have a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as "monopoly" too. With your friends you ran go to the movies, have a sleepover @CAPS5 play outside. Many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using "computer time." The last idea for ins tead of using "computer time" lis doing "you time indoors. WARNING! But @CAPS2 computer time! You could do something quite like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and quite to do instead of using "computer time." @CAPS5 you could even read a book too. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book. If you choose to do "you time, you will definately manage to undo that useless "computer time!" @CAPS6 of these "ideas" for not using the computer is very easy. It's not healthey to sit around the computer @CAPS6 day! Instead you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do "you time. but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal you can mange that!!!

Computers have caused many people money, friends and time. In fact, since that the computers came out this year, lots of people has been spending web to much time of them. Which can cause people to loose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. While doing this he and saves my parents money. This is @CAPS1 reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life. For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. This is @CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. For example, I used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @DATE1 to the computer. Since this helped I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1 way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. In your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers donot benefit us because they are stoping many people @CAPS3 exercising and healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are stoping many people, particular the younger generations, @CAPS3 exercising. Now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also recorded that any person who is on the computer for large amounts of times are hurting thier eyes, resulting in an increase of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunatly, many young people are not getting in to play sports. During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer. Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for aspact, kids ethier play with no heart or dont play at all. The reason for this is because they can instead work extremly hard on thier custom @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Also the computer is not the only electronic stoping kids @CAPS3 playing sports, xbox, playstation, xbox @NUM2, psp, @NUM3, gamecube and gameboy are some of the few console systems that play games that distract kids. I myself, had been caught thinking more about on xbox game then @CAPS2 own hackey game! not olny are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are they are alarming thier kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us dont know what its truly like to go outside and camp. do not to spend time with thier family. I came @CAPS3 on @CAPS5 family and many @CAPS5 families are very close, so its natural to be doing things with @CAPS2 father or brother or whole or cousin. However not to many families are as close as so they do not do something togther. If some fathers took thier sons fishing or camping, it would get them away @CAPS3 computers and the father/son band will become stronger. These are @CAPS2 reason sir and they should be thought over far quite sometime. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many play sports, and many families got to exprience the outdoors.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way.

Do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer? Many people use Computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support a trances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. I support computers because they help with writing, locking up information and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. You can tell I do not have the greatest hand writing. To help this, I type almost all of my papers. Computers can also help people with spelling and gramar. There are even systems now that let you say something and @CAPS1 will appear on the screen. This is just one reason I support computers. Next, computers are benifical because of the information they can provide. "before computers you would need to go to the libary and find around ten books that might not even have what your looking for. Now you can find hundreds of articals on any topic in minutes. The amount of information out there is un imageinable. I think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide. Finally, I believe computer are a benifit to us because of comunication. One term of communication that came out recently is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that let's you sent messages to a friend, share picture, videos and many more things. E-mail let's you send letters to people via internet instantly. I could go on forever about forms of comunication on the internet. This is the last reason I support computers. Computers are a great benifit to society. They help with writing, communication, and everyone could benifit form computers.

Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic.
<START>

I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like @CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also @CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. @CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and @CAPS1 you like it you could go @CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go. I think it a great thing @CAPS1 you look for people in the computer because you could talk to them and see them it realy cool. You can look for coltures in your computer what you want to learn. Like @CAPS1 you have a favert person you what to know about you can look it up in the computer and she videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there alot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you what. Also you can us othere people that are planing the game game as you. It realy cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot.

Dear local newspaper, Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like dieabeties, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this. Thats one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel dissapointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everthing together, and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why is think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safty. Those days computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safty and thats how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit? My opinion stillis the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. "@CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, @PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames @CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations @CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, @CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. @CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck @CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way.

Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about facebook, and got a membership. It just started out as a 'na big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's @CAPS2. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for @CAPS2 the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing @CAPS2 of her classes, and her mom took her computer priveleges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. "But, mom, i'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!" @PERSON1 says vistoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games @CAPS2 the TIME. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way with the interaction of him and his family. He @CAPS3't played eith his four year old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. his mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl @CAPS4 him, "@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot! and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get @CAPS2 kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just @CAPS5 for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are @CAPS2 kinds of distraction, and these are only a few.

Dear Newspaper, "@CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I don’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I @MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.

Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). The statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. You can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. It's very multi propose (use). But some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @CAPS4 cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one.

Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. There really helpful. They can teach us about things. Also they have fun games and websites which is always a plus. Computers are helpful in lots of things, like if you need to look something up for school you can just easily go on the computer and find it also some teachers have websites now where insted of bringing a big social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students rather use the internet book then taking the actual one home. Also if you forgot to write down your homework theres a website to lookup all the homework you have. Also computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and school related things. Also you can easilly go on google and look up things and they can give you thousands of information. Lastly the internet is a good source for fun they have millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking. This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day. So weither your using the internet for it's helpfulness its resources, or just for the fun games and websites. Computers are really helpful.

Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people.

Readers of "@LOCATION2 @CAPS1" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to "@CAPS2 to learn", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If "@LOCATION2 @CAPS1" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and "@CAPS5 @CAPS1" readers should be aware of this.

Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer @MONTH1 hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer @MONTH1 give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read a book or draw. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike. You can call up your friends and play with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, make up a game. At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's tempting. Even other people on computers is distracting. if you're working on the computer, it does not take much to to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company. See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and is very distracting. It is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me.
<START>

Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they effect us in a posotive way. Computers can help us explore far away places that we @MONTH1 never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not at all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place. "I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper incomg" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 school @CAPS4 I used my @CAPS6 and the internet to discover. HUNDREDS of amazing facts on it." @CAPS4 as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. A @CAPS5! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution a new wonderful machine called. The @CAPS6! You can chat long distances without being for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thoughy I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about @CAPS7 @CAPS8. It allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @CAPS4 can you! My finale reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? Well the @CAPS6 can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install softwear onto your @CAPS6 for a low price. And every @CAPS6 made in this world has internet capabilities. All's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @CAPS4 don'y worry about too much @CAPS6 use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @CAPS4 remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @CAPS4 get on, and get goin. Have you used your @CAPS6 today?

The use of computers is definetly correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you despretly need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheather, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get somebad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sae lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch videoes, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff. A computer can basicly do every thing from looking up the games scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously the best dicision.

Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of @CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computer. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computors are beaming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society. With computors we can learn anyting, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computors wisely, we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremly addicitve. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what internet was made for. Also, peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. Its anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year. Computors must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computors are a detriment to society. the can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society. Truly this is a good thing to let people use.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that "she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device. This has goting out of the hand and what ever is on the computer now will be on forever. More childern under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer know. Where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a childerns game that has a chating interaction, were you can talk to who ever. But, we you create this @PERSON1 you child has to give a parents email address were they have to read the following terms to chose for their child. But, most parents don't even read it . @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2, was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4" and around the age of @NUM5 said "@PERSON2 come get some candy" @PERSON2 said "how do you know my name"? "@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time" @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6 another intraction game and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our childern.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. Thats one of my reasons why I think people spend to much time on it my other reason is your eyesit can go bad. Its a nice sunny day dont wast your time on the computer! Go outside! All, kids @CAPS1 is sit on the computer all day not getting exercis. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because its true kids dont get up.There missing a nice day out would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My finall reason is kids eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, thats bad. @PERSON1 told me if your on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worst. I remember a tiny when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours my eyes were killing me everything I blink. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something ples. In conclusion just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1!

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say "@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are "doing something important" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family & friends.

Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often.

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable. My mother always says to me, "@CAPS1 you're @CAPS4 trouble finding @CAPS2, go on the computer," because she knows that there is all the @CAPS2 in books on the @CAPS3, and more. And it's just one click away, @CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, @CAPS5. @CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use.

Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been an argument wheter computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe, that computers have negative effets on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a forgein places? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about forgein places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just tree the person's e-mail adresses and type the message. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. In summarization, computers have a positive effect on people. It helps them have hand-eye coordination, learn about new places, and lets them talk.

Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time @CAPS2 is used for a good reason. Computers help out by making @CAPS2 possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. @CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you @MONTH1 use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making @CAPS2 possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. @CAPS2 is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring @CAPS2 up on the computer and do @CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, dont you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And @CAPS1 you type in "the most romantic spot in somers" @CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of spots. So dont drive to miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, @CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways @CAPS2 could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them. and even meet them someday. And @CAPS1 you and that new friend get along then mabey you and that person could be best friends. So @CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Were do you go? the computer, @CAPS2 can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. @CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you dont want to get a falling grade. on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And @CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and @CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish @CAPS2. Also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least @PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day and with out them our society would colaps/ @DATE1. So think about the decision you are making and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 will benefit our society or make our society @DATE1 to its knees.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with peopl, but think of how efficiant they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, "Computers are ruining our society.", please read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when I you hear 'computers'. Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other. I know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficiant. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmenship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your directions from. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game; a computer will suit you. There are. Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results. I urge you to remember; computer are a way to connect with people and they are efficiant. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.

I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, "why don't you stay after to do it?" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want.

Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in @CAPS1 strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are

@CAPS1 judgment comes from expirience, and expirience comes from bad judgement, qouted from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been around all that long for the public, so the public has little experience. Therefore, the public also lacks @CAPS1 judgement in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show. Computers have caused damage to people! To begin with, computers can be a @CAPS2 issue for people. In studies in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS3 who spend their time (@NUM3 or more hours) are wearing glasses. Because of bad @CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, which causes @CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of excercising. This @MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in @LOCATION2! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to get fat. As soon as he stopped playing it and going outside more he immediatly started to lose fat. Therefore, people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer. To continue, my second argument is about detrimental effects computers have on the enviroment. First, computers need electricity to run. That electricity comes from power plants. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's powerplants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas based. When people turn on the computer because they are bored, it wastes electricity that doesn't need to be used. Furthermore, scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming. It is common sense that those powerplants burn their respective fuels to create electricity. In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. Also, the powerplants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain. To end with, my last argument is about people's skills. In a school survey, @CAPS3 who used their computers for more than @NUM4 hours per day didn't know how to cook or how to even light a match! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible. The matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles, But what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4? How will @CAPS3 be able to fend for themselves? The only way to cook would be with fire. There wouldn't be microwaves to cook canned food with. Furthermore, how would @CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without @CAPS4 how to light a match? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Do you want @LOCATION2 to be thought of as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6? Should the enviroment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored people? How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming @CAPS6, @CAPS7 the environment, and losing important life skills. We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy, to retain our life skills, but most importantly ssave our one and only beautiful @LOCATION5.

Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said," @CAPS3 more, it builds character!" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. ( @CAPS5.S someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)

Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. @CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto @CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They @MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to @CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved everything you can physicly you can do on the computer.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do put possitive affect on people and it also teaches us. So I think computers are very important and they are needed in people lives. We learn information about the world and about what is going on. It also helps us comunicate with friends and family. Lastly it can help us gather information for homework and projects. First, while we are on the computer it tells us baout the world and different countries. The computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing. The computer also gives us information about local news such as weather, traffic reports and if there has been a crime that has happended. We also can find out about the stockmarket which is very important to many people. Second, the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family. AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all different ways to interact with each other. Also if we didn't hand something in at school we could always just e-mail our teachers the information that they might need by a spacific date, if a student forgets what the homework was we can just ask on the computer. Many people find old friends that they haven't seen in years, and getting to see them again and how their family is, it could make someone feel happy about knowing that their old friend has grown happy. Lastly, if students have project or homework that they need information on the computer could always help. On the computer there is a lot of information about people, places, thing, and anything you want to know. The computer gives you answer to question you @MONTH1 have. You can get pictures and information of the thing you are looking up. It also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up. Computers are very useful when it comes to sudents education. In conclusion, Computers are a very important part of everyones life. To learn about information that is happening in the world, to talk to friends or family, and to help with school work. Even if people aren't exercising they are increasing their education by finding information. You can still enjoy nature, but not as much as ussuall; you still spend time with family and friends by comunicating on the computer. Computers are one of the gratest inventions, and does have a positive effect on people.

Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1! Isn't computers just swell? I mean why aren't they you can one learn up on your knowledge, two you can play alot of fun games, and last but not least we can talk to our friend. Well I hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world. Have you ever had any diffuclty finding something in a libery? Well forget your libery cards just go on the computer's @CAPS2. On there you can fin what ever your looking for. One time I was doing a project on my favorite rocker @ORGANIZATION1, so my mom told me to check the libery for a book on him but I couldn't find one. So instead I just jumped on my computer but not really jump on @CAPS4 but any way so I went on the @CAPS2 and guess what! I found all I needed to know about him getting me that rocking at on my project. i mean ther's alot more you can learn with the computer like what's going on in the world around us or even learn about little world around us or even learn about little insects to big plants. Well that's what I got for using the @CAPS2 for knowledge. Welcome back! Well now I'm going to tell you about a few games you can play on the computer. The game I'm going to tell you about is my favorite game and @CAPS4's called left @NUM1 dead @NUM2; @CAPS5 you never played the game your probably like that game sound really hard and scary well @CAPS4 is. i'm just kidding @CAPS4 can be hard at first and a little scary but @CAPS4's still fun. Another game I enjoy playing is a online game called, '@PERSON1," the game is fun and all but @CAPS4 takes a while to do and kill the fun stuff. For example I'm a lvl. @NUM3 mage and I can take on lvl. @NUM4 @CAPS7 because I can use high leveled spells. but anyways there alot of things to do on a computer. Like me you can kill zombie hared or just do a quest or two, who cares @CAPS4's in you hands have fun. Now the last thing I'm going to tell you about is how you can talk to you friends over the @CAPS2. well like me I moved so I couldn't really hangout with my friends so I got there @CAPS9-mail so now I can talk and see my friends on a webcam. Another good reason to be able to use the @CAPS10 or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle joined the @ORGANIZATION2 and he's going to be leaving soon so I'm to be wanting to see him so I'll see him on webcam or be able to chat with him. Well that my reason why @CAPS4's a good reason to have a computer. One you can use @CAPS4 to learn, two some hard care gaming, and three just talk to friends. Thank you and have a nice day.

I agree with the newspaper, people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising. everyone knows computers addictive. but people need to get out more. but people making it more addicting by creating things such as never ending games and its distracting people from there life, family, work and exercise.

Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you think computers are great for everyone? I think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's really great about them is how much you can learn from computers. You can learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to people. Surely, read on to see why computers are very important to us all. Many people think that computers are bad for our mind, but actually they're not. When on computers you can learn hand-eye coordination. You can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper. Lastly, you can even have fun, relax, and type out your papers for reports. Definitely, read on to see what computers can @CAPS1 too. They're a lot of faraway places that have their own specil way of showing you a great time. On the internet, that have a list of vacation spots or places that grab your attention to visit. They give you details on why to visit it and a fair price. Think about it, would it be cool to visit a great place, like @LOCATION1. Without a doubt, continue reading. Have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around. Well, on the computer you can talk online to your friends. You can see how their doing or what their doing and still have a good time. Not to mention, you can even make new friends. Lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends. Surely, you should agree that computers are great. I think computers are very unique and important. That's why so many kids to adults use it the computers so much. They use it to learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to other. Thank you for reading my paper local newspaper.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 our technology advance, so do are lives. Computers are a perfect way to better our way of life in ways that are benificial to us and future generations. The use of computers, and the @CAPS5 alone allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on @LOCATION4 talk to people faraway, and express ourselves. Computers give us a bright future. First many people, actually @PERCENT1 of the worlds population are generally stationary, and line in a local town or city environments. This is why computers are so helpful because they give @CAPS2 a way to research other places around the globe. @CAPS3 can create an interest in other cultures, and shape our opinions @CAPS2 @CAPS3 discover things about other places. From there, @CAPS3 can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view. In doing this @CAPS3 will connect to other ways of life. @CAPS2 philosopher and poet @PERSON1 state" @CAPS3 learn about ourselves through the discovery of others." @CAPS4, another particularly handy function of the @CAPS5 through computers is @CAPS3 can communicate with people who live far away, when @CAPS3 couldn't visit otherwise. A @LOCATION2 study showed that actually @PERCENT2 of use of the computer is communication with sites like facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, says @CAPS3 @CAPS2 humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives @CAPS2 a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are gaining in popularity." And this is true. It is enjoyable to @CAPS7, talk, or email others. Without computers, this couldn't be possible. Lastly, computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before. Now, stars aren't only made in @LOCATION1, but now you can make yourself famous on @CAPS8 or @CAPS9. Just ask @PERSON2, who's voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like @PERSON2, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions. " About half of computer use, " says @CAPS1 to computer weekly, @PERSON4," is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas." @CAPS3 can persuade others to think @CAPS2 @CAPS3 do and discover thngs that @CAPS3 have discovered. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @CAPS2 it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future.

Dear People of @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend being active? Now answer me this, @CAPS1 much time do you spend on you computer? To many @CAPS2 today are sitting down in front of a computer, laptop, ecetra, while not enough are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are ruining us, they deter our social skills, damage our health and cause us to be lazy. They are unbenificial to our society. To start with, millions of people sign up for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and other website like these to reconnect with people. Do you realize what this means? Now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else. There is no longer a need to interact with other life forms, nor is there a want to. Lets say there's a woman sitting on her couch. All of a sudden her face lights up with the thought of her friend @PERSON1. She gets up to go start the car, but hey eye catches on the computer. She bites her lip, trying to decide wether to go see her, or have an online chat. Feeling lazy, she sits down. Do you really want that happening to everyone? To late it already has. Moving along, i'd like to take a moment to talk about our health. As most of us knows, fresh air is good for us. Imagine this, you're walking through the woods on a trail. The crisp, cool air, tickles you skin, and breathing it in just makes you smile. Your entire body feels energized from the treking. With passels of days like this ahead, you can'@CAPS7 wait. Now imagine this, your sitting in front of a computer, in a hot, stuffy room. You back aches from being in this posistion so long. Plus you think your getting a cold and you have migrane. You'd get off, but you have another app request. You @CAPS6'@CAPS7 feel like moving back to reality which do you prefer? Above and beyond all this, there's exercise to worry about. I mean, when's the last time that you yourself went on a bike ride? I'm sure you know that it's good for your body if you exercise, but your to busy on the computer. I think it's safe to say that half of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move. It's crucial to our health that we get active. To sum up, alot of us are pondering wether or not to spend more time on the compuer. Well here's you answer, "@CAPS6'@CAPS7." Not enough people are interacting now a days, their spending the best years of their lifes stuffed up in a house, and most importantly, let's face it, their getting fat. Computers are taking over our lives it's now, or never, make the change to a better and more satisying lifestyle. Please @LOCATION1, turn off the computer.

Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.
<START>

Do you think computers are helpful?

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 @PERCENT1 in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. The people are spending way too much time and not benefiting. Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way. People get adicted and distracted and can't get work done. Many inappropriate things are written in computers that children and adults shouldn't read. Lastly people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage. Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all. With children at school and adults at jobs, there is most likely a lot of work to get done, but computers should make a person not get the work done. The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework, but @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 kids in our class didn't have the homework. When the teacher asked why the kids didn't do their homework, they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When the children and adults don't get their work done then grades could be dropped, or people could get fired. The effect is very harmful, and all this happened just because of the adiction and distraction of computers. Since some internet sources are very social, and not all people are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read. Many children don't know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more, so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things? Adults @MONTH1 know more about the harmful language, but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones. If adults and children aren't exposed to these bad uses of language then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people. Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks time the person brain could be damaged. The screen of the computer in some way with the human brain and if stared at for too long the screen could permenately damage the brain. A @ORGANIZATION1 student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, "@CAPS2 help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done. The mechanics to make the computer screen are not healthy for you!" Who wants to have a damaged brain? Surely this effect could be very serious. So, in the end people should know that computers are not benefiticial. Computers effect people for sure, but not in a way that people would want to be effected. Adiction and distraction from the computer could cause important work to be ignored. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen. @CAPS2 try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer. It is very easy to stay clear of any negative effects but it is your choice whether to do so or not.

Every where you look people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our @CAPS1 work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. Because of saearch engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. The person you're talking to phnes only give you audio and that doesn't give you the some thing. video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far way and you cant him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is pne of the best ways to talk to people. Our @CAPS1 is mainly run on computers, without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat. The @CAPS1 uses computers to store thir legal files of court cases laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The store market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our @CAPS1 and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize and they help our @CAPS1 and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.

I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs.

Computers don’t have any affect on kids we just love going on cause we use it for help and this persuade the readers of the local newspaper cause we need to be able to communicate also do writing essays and doing social studies or science homework my ideas are let us go computers cause were not bothering u can just leave us alone and let us do what you need to do cause what computers are what give us information for we have to do and were to do wat we gotta do and u people can just leave us alone cause arent addicting to me or anyone and if we were it still would it matter cause a computers a computer u dont punish it because just punish us from the computer punish us because of it cause its the computer fault it can be addicting cause the computer is device that gives us wat we need and the information we also the computer does favors for us the computer is a amazing thing

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 concerned with an issue that people are using computers and not exersising. This is a very bad thing and we need to let the word out of what can happen if we don't exercise. The first reason why I disagree of the fact that computers help people is because computers really affect your health you will become fat you start having problems with your heart and it can lead to something fatal. Another reason why I think computers are healthy is because comptuers affect the economy alot in so many ways for example computers use up so much electricity it affects the power in all states. Computers also ruin jobs and this is very bad for the economy people will be addictied to computers for so long they wont bother looking for jobs they will just stay on the computer and gamble or buy stuff. The last reason why I think computers are bad is because of some of the illegal stuff people do on computers there are alot of cyber predetors that prey on kids and they end up finding the kid and kidnapp them. There are also other illegal stuff like bad websites or popups that can get you arrested so if kids go on computers they will not no what something means and they will click on it and it can traumitize a kid their whole life. So @NUM1 I hope you can take this letter into recognation and do something about it cause thes computers can affect my health your health and even your childrens health. That is why I have written this letter to you. If you agree with me I thank you.

Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them.

@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational, but should not replace everyday living. Therefore I think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantacy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumtion that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you see are real life situations and activities. Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in. It affects school work and how they behave. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality. Your family and friends have always been there for you. By your side even through your worst. Unfourtunetly, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them. They want a change so you can enjoy life again. Interact with a human being, not some graphic designed computer picture. That's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you. Your family and friends last longer than that. Your body is special and your health is important. A computer @MONTH1 suggest exercise but you are not going to really do it. You know that and the people who make computer sites know that. Your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. It is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. Your already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature. Run around or play a bill game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can effect a person. Not only do they mistake fantacy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the world.

Hi! My name is @PERSON1 and I think computers are not bad. I think this because yes, people do play the computer to much, but they can also learn a lot of things. Another reason is that some kids like bullys can stop bulling and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress. You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too. Computers can teach you a lot. For example @CAPS1 your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself. You can also learn or read the news that your missing. For example you can also ask questions that you don't understand and people would answer your question. In moder afoot kids, teens, and even adult computers to look up things that they don't understand. For example, when I read along a book and read a word that I don't know and read around @CAPS1 I still don't now I would go to @LOCATION1 and find what the words mean. Bullys and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer and you can just play games. They can play hitting games, shooting games, and even board games. You can even watch fights @CAPS1 you want. What ever you want you got it. This is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy. Bullys can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate. The computers can make you relax because you don't have to be around people and you can just tell the computer to do what ever you want. Kids, teens, and adult don't have to leave the house justto talk to a friend or two. I said this because most computers hace a microcam and you can comminicate with others. For example my dad is trying to get a computer with a micro-cam so that he can be incontact with my mom, my brother, my sister, and I. He has to get one because the doesn't live with us any more. He had to leave and go back to @LOCATION2. Another example, would be that @CAPS1 one of your friends move far, far away you can just talk to them on the micro-cam or even send message back and forth. So I think computers are not a bad idea or a bad things. I say this because you can learn, stay good, and communicate.
<START>

Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted compuer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to "pack on the pounds." @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversal topic. However, I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch. Computers @CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enourmous amount of benifits to today's society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand-eye coordination which is a tremenciously important skill. These advances in technology are extremely benefitial to our society and should be taken advantage of! "@CAPS1, @CAPS1!" @CAPS3 computer wails as I recieve a video call from @CAPS3 cousin, @PERSON4. The advantage in technology has provided many new ways for @CAPS3 family and I to communicate with each other. @CAPS3 cousins and I rarely see one another, but computers make it possible for us to stay connected. Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers or technological advances, their long-distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be possible. For example; I go on oovoo once a week to video chat with @CAPS3 cousin whom I only see on holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2 says: "Technology such as computers and cell phones are great for teens, but it should be monitored and not used excessively." Computers are great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance! Next, computers allow easy access to the news and online textbooks. @CAPS5 more people took advantage of this, we could sace millions of trees and have a healthier environment. Environmentalist, @PERSON3 says: "@CAPS5 more schools switched to online textbooks they would end up saving thousands of dollars that can be put elsewhere." I agree, @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS5 we didnt have to take home so many textbooks everyday, I might not have scoliousis!" @CAPS7, computers allow quick access to the news, so we can find out about accidents right away instead of waiting for the newspaper to come. @CAPS7, computers help children develop hand-eye coordination, which is a very important skill. Computer activities keep our brain excercising and @MONTH1 even help us hit more accurately next baseball season! Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 say that @CAPS5 they didn't have a computer growing up, they wouldn't be as good at their sport. Computers are an extremely useful recource for many things that we need to take advantages of!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!
<START>

Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people search @CAPS1 places, talk online with people like family and friends. First, the computers teach hand eye coordination it helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys I know it helped me and im sure it will help you too. Secondly, computers lets you interact with family and friends and lets you make friends like myspace you talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 ones facebook is more mature if you ask me twitter also its just away for you too talk to your friends yahoo, gmail, aol. Even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone. Next, it helps you search @CAPS1 and old places like landmarks or bussnesses like salons, nail palors. Gyms and @CAPS1 resturant you can even search when a movie is goin to come out. A computer can help you very much in this type of case. In conculsion computers are good they help you inform you and they can teach you I love my computer it helps me with homework and helps me study. Say you cant talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them and it's so cool/fun and it interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 things it lets you upload pictures, music videos and you can type essays. The computer is very educational.
<START>

There are so many different sides to this computer problem, well it's simple computers ruin our lives. Now think if it how many @CAPS1 do you see your kid on it? Computers messes up kids grades. It stops people from taking a car ride to @ORGANIZATION1's house. Also people don't ride their bikes a lot. Computers are an outrage. It first starts off with grades. The parents tell their kid go and start your paper. They sayd ok, and then they are down there on facebook. More @CAPS1 then not kids and parents abuse the computer. In fact @PERCENT2 of america do uses it, that might seem like a small percent but thats more than half the country. Me I don't abuse the computer be I need to keep @CAPS6 grades up. Most students have @CAPS2-average because studies show it's because of computers. Also if your son has a lapttop they're not doing work if that is what you think. I have computers, but we have, books for a reason, no spank, pop ups, or no distractions while working. Like one time I was working on a project, a pop-up came up and read trafic rush free to your computer. So dume me downloads it and @CAPS6 parents caught me playing. Has this changed your mind. Since you probably haven't changed your mind here is another thing way computer bad, your car. All guys love cars. Computers are holding more thand @PERCENT3 of people working or driving their cars. Te only person it hasn't affected is @CAPS6 dad, he works on his cars day in and day out. @CAPS6 grandmom said something interesting to me the after day,"@CAPS3 your dad comes up to visit me more can @CAPS6 other sons, @CAPS6 ohter sons are carzy for computers."People go bannas for computers today. Latly I have seen less and less people outside anymore. There is only reason for that, all people are shaved in their basement in the dark, so when their light it gurns their eyes it's so bright. Come on did this change your mind yet now. Well since you are still reading on that means you cannot make up your mind. Well here's this people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. That is facebook, this is what they thinks,"@CAPS4 it talk now why I need to ride to talk in person?" That @PERCENT1 right for what they are think. Because we task a test of all the kids who have facebook, and that's what around all of them said. I know amazing @CAPS5 a at home mother said," @CAPS6 son's gaining weight, all her does is eat and go on facebook. When he not on during they day, I catch him at night too." That is a sad story for that mohter. I ride @CAPS6 bike a lot, this is a real life story: once I was sitting around doing nothing really did @CAPS6 mom said we are riding bikes for @NUM1 miles. I got up end did it too. That had to change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusing I have no more ideas for no computers and why. But just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. So please, change your mind.

Dear, news paper I think computers are good, this is because you can learn thing's about faraway places using them, you can also hear about the most recent news and you can communicate with people. In school a lot of the research projects on other places focus on other places around the world. When you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story. Their are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts to multuplication tables @CAPS1 the computer is a good learning tool. The computer can keep you up-to-date with the news to! their are news website that post minute to minute things about world news and tell the world what kind of desaster happened in some far away place on the other side of the world. A lot of the time families are spread all over the world, you can chat with family or friend's that have moved by a simple chat room and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives and that's a good tool for family to stay in touch @CAPS1 the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning. About a faraway country to chatting with cuson that lives in california and also knowing whats going on in your own home town.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a lot of discusion of whether computers effect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers effect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their people skills" by talking through the computer, computers @MONTH1 also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what i know. most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hangingout with their friends they talk through the computer and if that what they do, more than hanging in person then they won't reconize the facial expressions given to them by certin people, while talking in person you get the full on experience of communicating with them. You get the tome of voide in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers effect every user and their families. @CAPS1 have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by ader users into showing them parts of their body to making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbulling. Cybe bulles lower yourself-esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadnt had any computer then none of these dangers would be occuring. With computers people have lost their judgement in top priorites. Some computers uses tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, schools work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer alot they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, their wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important thins than their online social lives."

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers do have a positive affect on people but I don't think because of computers is the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family well thats their choice and problem not the computers. Me for example I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homies. Now thats my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. It's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice. Only you know what is best for you.

Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that @CAPS1 spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of internet people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there. Our military uses internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also it helps us aquire great hand-eye coordination. If someone was planning a trip to @LOCATION1 they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out sites to go to in @LOCATION1. Second, they would check and compare hotels in @LOCATION1. Thirdly, they would check the weather in @LOCATION1. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from @LOCATION1. Without the internet planning vacations would be close to impossible. People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purphases too. They use web cams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is fast, free, and convinent way to communicate to other people. Our military uses web cams to let the soliders talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a solider fighting for you country and the means to talk to your family is out there, but you could not use it. It is cruel and unjust to keep soliders from talking to their families. Internet also gives us something usefull. It helps us build hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is used in many things. In basketball you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car. Without hand-eye coordination many more accidents would happen from carliess errors. Internet helps people make the world a safer place. In some aspects the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it as pleasure and build hand-eye coordination. Whle others use it to talk to their loved ones. Or use it to plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do internet plays an important part in life.

Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. "@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy.

As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance. In addition, people are becoming unable to envoy and appreciate nature while they still can. Finally, people are slowly being their ability to communicate with family and friends. As every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative affect on society. When the average, person uses, the computers, be it for business, homework, chatting, or just for fun, they are easily occupied for long periods of time. They consider themselves "too busy" for a thing called exercise which is becoming more and more curcial to our health and well-being. With music, walk, cool friends right in front of us, who has live. Time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? with computers, people are the will exercise. In this day and age, when is becoming a we need our exercise more. Every day rainforests indicated on the one, polluted, and clouded. We need and because of the realize ever a @ORGANIZATION1 screen. We need to write up and appreciate with the @ORGANIZATION1. As time goes by communication technology through the internet this issue of helping @CAPS1, healthy relationships is becoming a progressively worse issue. "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" is something that doesn't completely exist on the internet. This means that while you @MONTH1 find someone you can call a "friend" online, you never know exactly who they are until you've actually, met them...which could be potentially dangerous. Additionally, the very @CAPS1 emotions and human need for interaction that comes with relationships is something their can never be simulated or programmed, no matter how "advanced" your technology is. As you can see, the dependancy on and average of computers is having a negative affect in our society. We are not taking the time for exercise, and human interacting, all of which are to our health. And in a world where it's more important than ever to do. healthy, grateful, and diplomatic, we are slowly losing important. Therefore, @ORGANIZATION1, are having a negative affect on society.

There exercising there brian and they can interacte with people. So till next time

Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are a help to our plant. The new technology makes life easier to handle. The computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. Also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. The typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. The more you move them the more excersise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. Computers can also help by talking to people. To talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computer are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there is games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. Also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. You can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. Video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. On the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. In the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology. And be able to got better hand-eye coordination talk to people and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and amazed!

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @CAPS1 are thet not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. As a member of society, I knew I would not want to read something not typed anyway. The govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. You are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. if computers are important to them, the @CAPS1 could they be destructive to society? As a western middle school students, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen. After reseach is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assitance from computers, ahving naetly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. To conclusion, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. Without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?

Dear local newspaper I think that usieng computers help people becuse if we did not have computers we would not now ehey thing about eneyone or eneything like all of the @CAPS1 I would not now eneything about them but with computers I know alot about them and there lives like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head and. @CAPS4 got shot to and I know alot about the @ORGANIZATION1 there white people that to fear in to black people and the same with the wars like world @NUM1 and world @NUM2 and the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war there was like plain spy palin flying across @LOCATION1 and they shot him down becuse we were trying to see if thay had eney nuculer bombs offer there. And the same with google and yahoo with google you can type in eneything and you will get a answer and most liked a corect answer yahoo and google is great for some worke and products end studying becuse you then you do to and that I think that computer are good.

Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sights is all one sees. Unaware at there surroundings, many people zone to their computer screens and only break @CAPS4 absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become but that is what is society is creating. Computers do not create positive benefits to society. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyber bulling. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingriedient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour, without that necessity the bread will not rise its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions at our bodies. Exercise must be took part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles. In fact, muscles start it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise of outside play a days. Not many succeed with this goal, which brings up another negative effect to the body. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps to maintain strong bones. To get the recommended dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 a day you only need to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight a day. It doesn't seem like a lot but @PERCENT1 of our population is not outside to recieve it. Instead, they are inside on their computers. Parties, lunch breaks, or even a family dinner are great times to socialize. But, what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog. This is social time lost. If this habit continues you might soon see yourself drifting away from your friends because you don't make the time to spend lunch break with them. Even @CAPS4 a child interactions @CAPS4 chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, anything could be said. Children wont learn at a young age how to think on there fact language. This will effect their later years @CAPS4 interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs. Social skills are the difference between success and failure. Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in their while at least attempting to be an extreme will turn you @CAPS7 and @CAPS7 are all created with the ominous cyberbulling. One simple way to prevent this is spending less time in the computer. The effects of cyber bulling can be brutal. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in face then over the internet. The reason being a of cruelty is displayed through cyberbulling over the internet because it takes much less courage to type something up then it for a bully to say something to them victims face. Such cyberbulling has even led to suicides. In fact, a girl in committed suicide due to cyber bulling just @NUM2 weeks ago. If you don't have In conclusion, computers produce more negative effect on society than good. A lack of exercise and proper body maintenance results. Reduced social interacting and skills also result. And maybe most importantly cyberbulling which takes lives occurs. In prevent society from turning into a social waste and felled with the glow of computer screens, lets all turn the monitor and get outside with nature and all its benefits.

I belive that computers benifit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now and everywere you go you usualy see one. That must meen people love then. These are so many uses and fun expeirences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier. they make people happy because you can play games like tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Compuer games make people happy because when ever they are bored and does nothing going on you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball and other great game. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds. Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money. It also saves on polution because if a car isn't going out there is less so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures. For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A. this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benifit the society. They make us happy, made us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too.

Dear local Newspaper. I am stating my opinion that the more people use computers the less they spend with their family. I have three ressons why computer are good or bad. Not every one agrees that computer are benefitsal for the society. The positive effect and negative effect that computers have on people. My resson for supporting this @CAPS1 that computer are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people. The second @CAPS1 is to be able to talk to other people on line. The last @CAPS1 I have is Spending more time with family than on the computer. The first resson that i have for computers is how they have for computers is how they have positive effect on people. The examples that I have to Support this @CAPS1 are that computers tech hand eye coordination, computers given people the ability to Learn about far way place and peop. The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook. The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of theis thing can be good if you don't post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook. I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend. The third resson I have to support my @CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time I have example on want we should do with or familys instead of being on the computers I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our familys instead of being on the computers, The games that we can play with our familys are monopoly, somy, canda landy card, video games, we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time. When we can injoy want we have in live not just with computers but with our family. Inconclusion I am statting my opinion that the more time people spend on computers than with their own family. I have three resson on why computers are good or bad. The r\ess that I have to support my @CAPS1 are that computers have a positive effeck on people, to be able to talk to people online, To spend more time with family than on the computer.

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros. Some pros are they show magnificant pictures of nature and it would pictures until you want to send them by email. You can even order tickets for planes, trains and movies. Let's not forget shopping and internet. If you go on the internet you can find many pictures of any thing you want. Such as pictures of nature, celebrities. About @PERCENT1 of all picture on the internet are true. A computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera. It can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it. The computer can even email the pictures to any email that exsist. If you want to go to the movies or on vacation you can get the movie tickets online. You can get them at any ticket sales website. If you want to go on vacation you can get your hotel tickets even your plane train, or boat ticket online. Buying tickets isn't the only thing you can do on the internet you can buy stuff to. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, game cube, x-box, x-box @NUM3, wii, you even computer games. You can even buy the game systems. You can buy house hold appliances. Also you can put clothes and other store products an hold. The internet you can watch videos an almost any website you go on. Some @MONTH1 be grass, some @MONTH1 be funny others @MONTH1 even be wierd. @PERCENT2 of all teenagers like watching music videos. Some are just the artist sing and dancing in a background other times people make fun of other artists. Even though computers do have pros and cons they have more pros. Like the examples in the passage above.

Dear local newspaper I don’t agree with the people who say people spend to much time on their computers. Because people can lean mostly anything they want all of a computer also there are lots of resomes why people should use advances technology they can teach kids how to find out answers to there homework the fastway instead of reading a book or taken a class and still get the full understeading. The people that say others spend's to much time on there computers are also right about that but they still can interact with friends and family they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature you cant do that on a computer but you can help the nature on a computer like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spred the word and on that blog it can stay stop cuting down trees for stores or stop killing animales for there far or anythin you wont to write. So the people that do read this you should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn lot more then you ever thought you could. So go out and find you a computer and find somethine you need to do or learn or just to have some fun.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. @CAPS1 first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost. It also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit. @CAPS1 third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online. Other people work online. This benefits people in a positive way. In conclusion computers have a positive effect on people because its helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then @CAPS1 are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People @MONTH1 become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @CAPS1 are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you.

Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society.

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some "experts" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, "The more children use computers is the more time they waste @CAPS3 not being active at all." A study conducted @CAPS3 the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer @NUM1 hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you @MONTH1 think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can "talk" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in privite and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? "Experts" on computers say that computers can be used for infenite nolege. The key word in that fraise is "can". just because kids have knoledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have record kids say "@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on google." @CAPS3 copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society @CAPS3 making people fat, socialy weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good?

Dear Local newspaper, I just read about your article regarding the computer usage. In my opinion I think that computers are a good thing. Yet, I believe that it could have a negative influence as well. I believe that computers are one of mankind's best technologies. You can type, learn about historical happenings, different places, and different cultures as well. You can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam. That's what I use to speak to my @CAPS1's who live in @LOCATION2. Computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life. However, although computer can be such a good thing, it can be bad as well. A lot of people over used it too. I infact know a person and she's a very nice person. She's sweet, caring, loves kids, and has a kind heart. The only thing is, is that she's a @CAPS2 addict. She loves @CAPS2. Sometime when she comes over, I'll be using my laptop and she'll ask to check her @CAPS2 status. My point is, is that she allows @CAPS2 to take over her. not cool. I read an article the other day about computer usage in @LOCATION1. Dr. @PERSON1 covered this article on the topic of computer usage. She said "The average american spends four hours or more on the computer. Although there are other people who spend their time outside when it's nice. I congradulate them on that". See, now you heard it from the expert as well. In cocnclusion, I would like to state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well. So it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it. So my point that I would to come across @LOCATION1 is that use you computer wisely. Don't spend all of your time on it. Life's too short for that. So spend time with family and friends and go outside too!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much time do you spend on the computer daily, @NUM1 hour, @NUM2 hours. While computers, are amazing advances in technology they are also very bad for you. People spend hours at at time on the computer causing less time exercing, horrible speaking, and dangerous searches. From @DATE2 to @DATE3 the numbers of obese people increased from @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION2 citizens to @PERCENT1. In a recent study the amount of families with computers is now @NUM3 out of @DATE1 compared to the @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. Scientist wonder if they were connected and relized they were. People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary life style. They are more likly to go on the computer than go exercise. The lack of exercising causes obeseity, and cardovascular problems. Without this valuable exercise more people are . At a visit to the hospitial a surgen said he has seen a huge increase of heart surgreys in the @DATE1. We found that the computer manual booklets says to only go on for an @NUM1 hour at a time. The hottest thing online these days is social networking, whether @CAPS6's twitter, or facebook. These social networking allow teens to talk with there friends. But @CAPS6 really isn't talking. For example they write @CAPS3 @CAPS4 going @NUM2 dance. Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammer. And this language doesnt just stay online, @CAPS6 is now now they talk. @PERSON1 the grandmother to a social networking said, "I can't even have conversations with her because she is is talking like she is on the computer. @CAPS6's so sad." @CAPS5 for public speaking and english class, @PERSON2 an english teacher for @NUM7 @DATE1 states @CAPS2 she has seen a drop in teens ability to write gramaticly correct and @CAPS2 when she corrects essay the are written is social networking form. "@CAPS6's hard to see litiature dissolving because kid are spending so much time on the computer. The average day for children in @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home. @CAPS2 would you like your child to be surfing the internent alone without you for hours when you don't know what they are doing. Parent blockers can only do so much. Children can find out the password and net around @CAPS6. The dangers are always there. You can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information. You dont know what your child is searching or who they are talking to on the computer, @CAPS6 could be "@CAPS8," the who lives four blocks over.

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 some beleive computers do not benefil society, I do. Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like @CAPS2 and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. Knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. Eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder.

Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find "friends" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their "friends" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it.

Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't undeRstand that they are missing of. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. Is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. Is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize thats the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my , i ask you to think about yours.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memerize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do, you don't have to serch the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.

Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The "computer age" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing.

Computers are over used and controll the minds some people. Computers are parcally to @CAPS1 for americas high obesity percentage. Americas teens are not doing homework. And noteveteing time into school because of computers. These high tech machines should be outlowed and given to only those who truly need them. People spend way to much time on computers. The time people spend on the computer is time they should be exersizing. Computers make people obees studys show that @PERCENT1 of obees americans admit to being adicted to the computer. This is why computers are bad. The internet on computers is unsafe. Expers say that popular chating sites such as myspace are the reason for the sudden incroas in murders, and rapings. The number of convicted criminals as well as sex affenders i tramendus. Yet parents lot the children on them. People don't understand the troubles computers cause. Besides the other factors computers retard teens learning. Teh comkputer is suposed to be a helpful tool and used for leanring. But computers are being used for other things. Computers encourage kids not to study or do homework. Although those are useful becoming sites and tools, these tool arent used often. Computers hurt people in many ways. America should have off computer week to fight back from its evil grie on children. I hope one day we can all turn off out computers for good.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @CAPS1 research about the past. Also I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing.

Dear Local Newspaper, everday @CAPS1 technology is developed. One of the biggest and most popular machines in the technocle society is, the computer. Some people don't like computers. The think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodys. The reason I'm writing to you is to presuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer. For starters computers help us recive/give @CAPS8. One of the great featurs that computers give is email. Without email, we would be completley out of the loop. For example @CAPS2 there is a snowday at your childs school, you recive an email from the usper intendent saying school si cancled. Without that email, we woulden't be able to know that @CAPS8. Another example, @CAPS6 say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold. You don't feel good and need to call work to report being sick. Now you're stuck because you have no voice. @CAPS2 you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another posative tool computers gives us is making communicating esayer. With all of the social networking now avalible like @CAPS4, twitter , @CAPS3 and yahoo messanger. It nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and faimly using @CAPS4, you can look up old friends and faimly. Once youve found them, you can friend request them and become online friends. Once youre online friends you can instant message, video chat, look at their status, and browse their photos. So with a computer @CAPS7 nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch. The last and final reason computers are great is because, they make shopping much esayer. @CAPS2 you have used amazon, ebay or overstock, you know what I'm talking about you can buy almost anything online. From electronics to @CAPS5 animals. The list is endless. With a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online. For example @CAPS6 say your home from work with explosive diharrea. But @CAPS7 @DATE1 so you need to go grociery shopping. You've been on the toilet @PERCENT1 of the day and alls youve got is your laptop. Well you can shop online. So as you can see computers help us communicate, shop and get and recive @CAPS8.

To editor, @CAPS1's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees. But you don't notice any of @CAPS1 because you're plopped down in front of your comuter tapping away on @CAPS2 or email. With modern technology. This is a common scenario. Experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health, hamper your social skills, and cause you to be disconnected from nature. While computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing. As mentioned, camputers have can a negative effect on your health. Computers cause people to be lazy. They would rather @CAPS2 and email than go outside and excersize in the cool, crisp, fresh air. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @NUM1 leading reason for obesity. And weight problems are not the only thing computer to worry about. Too much time in front of the computer will also take @CAPS1's toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed @CAPS1. "@CAPS4 since computers have become a common household item, the number of i have eye has gone up about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids every year than the year says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. And if that isn't enough, typing too many this @CAPS5 and emails day after day can give you repetetive syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel used to be more when typewriters were big, but dwindled down once computers with newer, easier to type on keyboards came around. But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up. @CAPS1 is clear that if you want to stay healthy, computer usage should be limited. Secondly, too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others. Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone but people have gott on so used in @CAPS1 that they sometimes find @CAPS1 awkward to talk to someone face to face. Their eyes look everywhere except for the person, they shift their weight back and forth and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy. This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships. Friends will talk to each other endlessly through @CAPS2, but have no words for each other when they meet face to face. I remember @DATE1, i didn't see one of my friends at all; we just @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found @CAPS1 hard to carry a conversation and @CAPS1 took some getting used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way friendships are ut on the line by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations @MONTH1 sometimes be. You're on the phone with your friend and you're telling her about something important that you need advice on. A few seconds after you begin talking you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by a "hold on, so and so just @CAPS8 me." @CAPS9, computers seriously social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to watch how much time you spend on the comuter is that @CAPS1 can cause you to
<START>

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are beinging questioned if the are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are good and bad you really can't pick a side. These good because children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school, it allows people to chat with others in different places, and it helps hand-eye cordanation. Those were the good here are some bad things about compters. People spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising, they dont' get to enjoy nature, and people stop interacting with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because i can relate to both sides. For example. one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat's with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when i live here in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 my mom and stepdad live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 so i don't see them much but thanks to computer i can chat. With them when ever i want to. Honestly i wouldn't know how my life would be like if i didn't have a computer and i wasn't able I @CAPS4 now. Although, can also to one or the bad things about computers, which is that people spent to much time on the them. I can relate to that and so could of the other well, because when i around @NUM1 because go to a after school, go straight on my laptop and around @NUM2. When my grandma @NUM3 pm. She always comes in and "Your on that thing to much you your hands!" in her. So in my opinion I believe that coumpters can be good for our socity and bad; for me there is no side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others @MONTH1 not. It's up to them to make a choice, so ask your self," @CAPS4 you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this contraversal subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; weather its for games, the buying and selling of items, talking with people in different countries; the possibilites are endless. This is, however, not nessessarally a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Esspecialy adolesents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!
<START>

There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending to much time on computers they are good to be on for a while but not all day. So @CAPS1 first reason why I think spending to much time on computers is not a good thing because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people all day instead you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else and if your on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends. @CAPS1 second reason why I dont think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if your not exercising you will start to gain weight cause your sitting all day just on the computer so its good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise is good for you it will keep you healthy cause I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you alot and they do but it is not good to be on it all day. @CAPS1 last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things they could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you to be on the compute even longer you could even become addicted to being on computers because your doing nothing else ans some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for same bad things so thats why it is better not to be on a computera ll day long. So these were @CAPS1 reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I do agree that people should stop spending most of thier day on the computer and start to exercise more or spend time with friends and family. The computer has the ability to let you learn about faraway places but instead of sitting behind a desk and learning about somewhere faraway you should go outside and see it for yourself. Also our country is one of the top @NUM1 that has fat people and I believe that the computer has something to do with this because most of the kids in our school have a facebook and about @PERCENT1 of those kids are on facebook for at least an hour. This is why people should stop using the internet for most of their day because they are not getting the exercise they need that is why our country is one of the top @NUM1 in the world that has most fast people. The internet does allow you to chat with family and friends but you still need to hand out with your friends outside so you can exercise by playing sports or just going for a walk down the block if you don't you will not have a healthy relationship because someitmes they @MONTH1 not even be on the computer so you can chat with them online. Also if you don't go outside and enjoy nature and play with friends then you will become very lazy just by sitting in a chair all day and you would'nt care to do anything anymore.
<START>

Dear, Newspaper I would like to tell you about computers, without them this world would fall apart. For example, some peoples jobs are to fix them, make then, sell them, also some people work from home and need the computer for their jobs. Without them soo many people would @CAPS1 out of jobs and geting paidless. Also, kids need them for education reasons, for example, if you had a broken finger and couldent hold a pencil you would have to type. In addition, what if a student needed an answer to a question and there has no to help them they could go online and get the answer and learn. Theres many ways a computer run help a person. For example, they could need directions or some ones phone number or answers. Also, you can buy off line what if you live too far away from your favorite stare you can fast or der it off line. Also I believe kids should get off the computer any go out side and exercise, to day there is to many over weight people if people what for a walk instead of siting on the computer all day there woulden @CAPS1 as many over weighted people. In addition, people need exercise without it people would get faty, lazy, sleepy, and some sick, and angery, deppression. it would @CAPS1 to every ones benifit if people would exercise more. In addition without computers alot or peoples lives would fall apart, people just need to exercise more and everyting will @CAPS1 fine.

Coumputors are mind browning on what they can do. They can make or break somone financhely. They also can perduce amasing graphis that aritist cant perduce. Coumputrs are also for great for recer antal acitivitys, and they also take your life away. I not talking about a real life @CAPS1 talking about the activitys you do away from home. Now lets see the benifits and problems we come so far on how we handle money. We use to put it in chets and hide them now all we do is click and type in a securty number. people can also invist in items but invisting is tricky you dont always win. You can win small or lose big they say @CAPS2 coumputers today are hd. The screens are made of a liquid crystal fourmula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the wort to bring stunning graphis to life. On coumputers today people make money by selling graphis they made on coumputers. So this would be another plus on what a coumputor dose to a human. I went to a school to lern how to perduce great graphis. All teens kids and adults have used a coumputer for recerantol acivitys. On todays coumputors you can play games watch videos, and listen on coumputors. People do this to engoy then selfs. Some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while, personly I like to go on youtube and find funny vidos after school. I use to own a youtube account and get many views. The worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan gobo or somones socal life some people get addicted and cant stop being on the coumputor until it is takin away. For example some people play world of war craft get addicted and cant stop! I had a problem when I had to chek you tube a lot. Well I hoped you readers. No matter what happens I think coumputors bennafit more than the problems

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a sought after item in this day in age, and we are making advances in technology every single day. Social networking sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are all over the internet. Computers are good to some exstent, but some kids find the computer essential to their life. Using computers too much will have a bad effect on society. Oreos, @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 are all common sparks for people to be eating while on the computer. Now when you're sitting on the computer daily and for hours eating these sparks. You are begging to become overweight. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids are overweight and that is unhealthy. A collassal piece of this @PERCENT1 use the computer daily. There is no doubt obesity is a problem, and computers are making it worse. The people that love to use the computer definetly have some sort of social network account, @MONTH1 it be @CAPS5, or @CAPS4. Kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves. In one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her. Three have been other cases in which girls have sent a nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people soul it. There lives will never be the same because they were using the computer too much. Soon we will become the leader of @LOCATION2 and we will get to the decisions around. If we are getting to know our outside world and we are not learning how to to be social without the internet, don't know how we will end up. will be the ones and all that important stuff. Instead of typing away we should explore the world and learn important things. Hopefully, as @CAPS10, we will become independent on computers and we will fit this problem by sending less time on a. Computers are great thing but they should not for going outside with friends and playing baseball.
<START>

Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book. For intinst, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn. Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away. Like me for instints, I live far from my friends. And the only I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with Family. Lets, say your childre go on vacation and wants to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and its at the other computer instintly. But, if you was to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games, to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash macromedia is the best though. You get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. a computer has so many advanrages in today society. Which i'm very thank full for computers and all of the great stuff you do. That is why I believe computers benefit society.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the"@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love" @CAPS2"@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, You @MONTH1 have heard that there are up-sides and down-sides to using a computer. There are many more up-sides though. For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries. By doing this we can learn what life is like for them. Through social networks, such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. Computers are an important communication technology. Today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is all computerized today, and that is a major trade way today. A lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there. Computers are a huge advancement in business. Computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click. This research can be used to write essays in school. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It @MONTH1 have a few down-sides, but it has many more up-sides. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up.
<START>

In my opinion, having computers is avery nice thing and does good in our society. I think this because of three reasons, @ORGANIZATION2, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends, @CAPS1, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. @ORGANIZATION2 off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, thats a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on @CAPS2 and watch funny videos or go on @CAPS3 and on you friends new photo album. Your @ORGANIZATION3 computer is to do many things. There are @CAPS8 many game , such as @CAPS4 come or @CAPS5 cam that can be a lot of fun. Do you see why the computers a good way of calming down? Other than winding you down on a rough day at work, on the computer @CAPS8 allow you to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together. Or, you can just have simple talk @CAPS3 and @CAPS7 are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of you, @CAPS8 even make new friends. A lot of teenagers and adults have @CAPS3 because it gets. So @CAPS4 that you can't get off it. As you get older, you dont talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. @CAPS3 prevents that so you can always talk to them. You should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for school work. Without it you can't get picture off @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay that due. @CAPS8, you can't search words on @LOCATION1. Some teachers require you to type out essays and other don't. You need a computer if your teacher require you to type things. I go on swifts website to see if i have homework dure and that helps me out a teachers @CAPS8 put extra credit online. All in all computes are good for society. @ORGANIZATION2, you can just calm down and relax. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. @CAPS1 and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and up pictures/ . Now you must understant when i tell you that computers are important and very useful in society.

Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are. the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, "@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information." Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive most of the world and I rely on computers to talk to out far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says. "I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it." This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and Family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life.

Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other tasks done. Such @CAPS2 working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @CAPS2 "@CAPS1". "twitter", and "aol". People in the workplace are distracted two. Sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing." @CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up." @CAPS3 to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. Also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. Hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family.

Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more. Than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever. Thank you so much for takeng you own @CAPS4 Time to read this article I hope you would remember this article for your whole ontire life.

Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who don’t like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do.

Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people.
<START>

Dear,newspaper I think that people should have computers I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or read and grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos and they could pay there bills on the computer to and they dont have it in the store of kids need to do there homework computers are good for that buy thet also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook. or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that? Why I think we should have computers.
<START>

Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they @MONTH1 need for school. People can talk to there friends on things like facebook or @CAPS1 and you can write a rough draft on the computer save it then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final. I will elaborate in the following three paragraphs. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book. A book would probably take up more time and you @MONTH1 get less information. For example the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of information. Another reason computer reasearch is quicker is that you can go from one page get some information and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more you can just click another link. If people didn't have computers they would have to go to the library and spend time looking them. Is it worth it to use all that time. People can talk to there friends on facebook or @CAPS1. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more. What if your on vacation and your so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non stop for a week and you miss your friends. All you have to do id turn on the computer and then you have an intent link to them. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over on enywhere in the country. They @MONTH1 even became your new best friend. When you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it @NUM1 more times? Theres a much simpler way it's called a computer. You can write your first draft then all you have to do inordre to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are nessecary. Computers also help kids spell better. All they have to do is hit a button.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you turn there is technology. It's not going to change. Try a schedule. Encouragment helps a lot of people. Activities keep you mind off things read on to find our more. Scheduleing is important. Limit the time on the computer. For every half hour at least @NUM1 minutes outside or with friends. try to memorize the schedule. Encouragement helps me and alot of people! Try to encourage family and friends, The goverment is also trying to fight this. Encouragement helps. Activities can keep people off the computer. Try neighborhood activities. After-school activities for a while. All kinds of stuff is fun. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep you mind off things? then by far this stuff helps.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction? Its not such a far fetched idea. Some people @MONTH1 see this as a great advancement. Not me. I think that computers detach people from reality, create false personas, and has no physical benefit. This is what i think the computers effects have on people. First of all, Computers detach people from reality. Its a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer, browsing aimlessly on some social networking website, than go out and actually meet new people. Sure you @CAPS2 send all the friend requests you want, but theres nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person. The computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them. Secondly, the computer creates false personas. If i had a facebook or @CAPS3 account, it would be very easy to say something false about myself, or someone else. The computer dosn't know better. This allows people to gain, "friendships" with others that dont know the real you. I find this as a real problem because eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationshops. Lastly, I think that the computer offers no physical gain, This nation is in a severe heath crisis. With things easier to get now a days like fast food, and drugs, I don't think that computers help. People need discipline and theres a time and place for everything, including computers. However those that aren't disciplined might use them more than they need to and that isn't good. So @CAPS2 you imagine a world controlled by computers? I think that little by little, thats whats happening, slowly taking away the human element. I think the effects will be severe, detaching reality, creating false personas, and offering no physical gain. I don't think its right, but I hope I've persuaded you to think my way.
<START>

Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.

How @MONTH1 times do you use the computer in one day? A lot right? I think that computers definatly benefit society. The internet helps a lot of people, because its very conveniant computer give people. The computers also lets people talk online with other people. Computers help people because of the internet. The internet makes alot of peoples live easier. One way is for school. I know from my own experiences that the internet helps. If I dont have enough material to study, on the internet help. Another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people the age of @NUM1 have jobs on the internet? The internet can also help people find jobs. The last reason that the internet is helpful is shopping, I remember a time when i needed a special book for school and no book store and no bookstore, my mum ordered it of fine, the internet is very helpul to many people. My that computers are beneficial to our society is that they people the ability to faraways places. many people cannot offerd to go to a lot of places outside the united state., With computers, people can team about there places and at of these places. Sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there. Another reason that are using and want to learn more. Once, any family got to a wedding in @LOCATION1, but we didn't know much @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 we went online to find things like. The foods eaten there and what the weather is like. lastly people can learn about where their family corner form. If people know the place that their ancestors came from, but they look it up crime computers. They confind recipes for food, what relign they practice, and what holidays they celebrate. Obuously computer help people about faraway places. My last reason that computers are beneficial to or society is that they allow people to talk with other people. Sometimes, good friends who wants to together loss touch or if one friend, people can find online and take. Did you know that their are many sites that tell you where people you went to highschool with are? Also, there are sites like facebook where people can connect. Another reason is that, people can meet other people online. their are many dating sites such as, that connect people losing that internet. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of people on dating, sites set ? Sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance. Being able to chat onlinee a sites like google, chat or all is very helpul. Without a dubt, computer are very helpful. I think that computer help @CAPS1 many, people in our society. People use the internet to help them. People learn about other places and people ccan chat online. -@CAPS1, dont think body about computers, because they have impaced our society greatly!

Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millenium brought a new wave of technology. Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day some one might want to go to the bahamas, but then finds a new location such as @LOCATION1 or even @LOCATION3. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first. Recently my grandmother moved down to @LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see me grandma. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases. For example @CAPS1 or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand-eye coordination because you are doing two things at once. A sport that requires a lot of this is @CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand-eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intellegence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to becaome one of obese, lazy with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lock a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive of computer usage our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and loose, brain washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciacion or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside going from a respected world power, to a third world country in. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use they. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well known psychologist, "People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression." Friends actually affect you health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and became separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you onlr communicate through e-mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enbough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit oyur computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature, People used to care nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we @CAPS2 and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will dissapear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about "Computers" is very well thought outside of the box.Well. We sure need computer to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it dident existed before? Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @CAPS1 oppinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who knows and not trying to be mean. For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside of fresh air. In conclusion, internet these days are very good for people.
<START>

I think the use of computers is very good things in the present day @LOCATION2. I think this because people use it to research, stay in touch with friends and family, and music. These are all things adults and kids need a like to do. read on and I will explain why this is so important. My first reason why I think computers are good thing is because the are a good source to do research on a specific topic. Kids all over the @LOCATION1 use the internet to do class projects. Adults can use the computer to look up a certain food resipe. If you need help with something the computer is allways there. Some people even use the computer for a job. Computers can help with a lot of things. Another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family. A great thing to use on a computer is a web cam. With this you can see and talk to people on a lillte camray even if they are far away. You can also go on myspace of face book. Theare two websites that are used to post pictures and to talk to chosen friend. It is a good way for people to get to know you. A similar thing to this is instant messaging. You can use this to talk to friends and many on line. Don't stop reading there is more thing! My last reason why computer are sutch a great thing to have is because you can do do mutch with music on the computer. You can use the computer to listen to music, and put music on to and ipod or @NUM1 player. Some people use the computer to make music. You can get a progrem that you can make heats and put it together to make some kind of a song. music is a great thing that all age groups love. That is why I think haveing a computer is a very positive thing. You can do researching, say in touch with friends and family, and do a lot with music. There is so mutch more then thease @NUM2 thing that a computer is good for. I don't think the world would be the same without computers.

Dear newspaper, I know that computers can place a person in its spell, but in reality it's one of the most necesary things we need in our lifetime. Computers are used for many things like school work, planning that trip you always wanted to go to, and reading the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as you can so you have that at. When you realize that the one book you find on it wont help you with the score you want you realize that the nextplace to look is the computer. The computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, "The life and times: @PERSON1" You want to go beyond what they give you and search, for instances, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a "five nights and four days" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest only find out by computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1 this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you wont know that all the beaches open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your erea, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. Out of those people, @PERCENT2 said they rarely go outside because theu are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some tyoe of exercise. @PERSON2 stated, "this shocking @CAPS2 means that most -if not all- all people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved." @CAPS3 goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes ti unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become, modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer. @PERSON3 agreed with this statement and said, " I am a college greaduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would." This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. @PERSON3 regreted it all and changed his ways once @CAPS3 got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @LOCATION1. The most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. Thank you for your attention, and remeber one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, click, clack that the sound @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3. In @LOCATION2. Dreadful, humble, time conservative computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments @ORGANIZATION2 life that are offered to us. Computers are our sourse @CAPS5 infromation, and time @CAPS5 liesure these days, but we are fogetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful, nature. To much use @ORGANIZATION2 a computer is leading to aweful health. Computers can cause many fatal problems such as seeing and vision problems, and obisity, due to the fact that you sit all day and @CAPS2't work out. Computers are like mind, and body eaters the slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weap @CAPS5 the rest @ORGANIZATION2 your life, @CAPS2't you agree? Do you know the @ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause @ORGANIZATION2 obisity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experinced problem. While growing up. When I was @NUM1 I was adictied to the computer. Day and night my eyes were guled to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except @CAPS5 computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful faton myself, and later I found out I was over weight @CAPS5 my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are to. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating to much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stps us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealth. As said by @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 people from the state @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many family these days. Do you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as the wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a resipe online to make @CAPS5 dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes that happens a lot, insded @ORGANIZATION2 doing those things they could be doing something else, but no computer work is more important. My family used to spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time together, but because @ORGANIZATION2 the computer I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know the time health @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become more better parents than who @CAPS2't spend time with family. I bet you are a really good family man/women and spend time with please take these computers away and make families come together once again. @LOCATION1 has the most beautiful nature ever, the birds, the animals, the @DATE1 times and the fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come to @LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1 aren't appriating nature themselves because they are do busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a comp out, and we were ready @CAPS5 nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole got people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen one the such as yellow @CAPS3 through that time was amazing and it is very unfortunet that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not apricating nature, which one day they will regret, because @ORGANIZATION2 the fact the one day you @MONTH1 not be around to enjoy this got given @CAPS2't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and @CAPS5 ourself. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out their enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy. Be the smart, and well educated people. (I know you are) and tell the world to not getting told by the computer @ORGANIZATION2 what you can, and cant do, be the boss control. Yes computers are fun, giving, but is bad. Say no to computers if you @CAPS2't you will regret it.

Dear Readers of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 has been borught to my attention that there is dilema on the effect of computers on people. Well I believe that having computers around are good because. Computers help students do there school work better. They also give the ability to learn about far away places. Lastly, computers allow people to talk to othe people online or webcam. My first reason I believe computers are good to have around is. They help students do there school work. Sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay. @CAPS2 the student does @CAPS1 on a computer they might get a higher grade because @CAPS1 looks neater and more proffestional. Computers especially help out college students. A college university took poll one time. @PERCENT1 of student wouldn't know what to do @CAPS2 they didn't have there computer or laptop. One student even said "@CAPS2 I didn't have my laptop I would probably fail most of my classes." Computers can be very helpful when @CAPS1 comes to student school work. My second reason that I believe computers are good to have around is. They give the ability to learn about far away places or other coutries. I took a poll one time of how many people use a computer to find out whats going on in other countries, @PERCENT2 of them said they go on the computer to find out what's going on in another countries. Computers can be very handy when you want to know whats going on in other countries. My last reason why computers are good to have around is. Say you married and you are pregnant unless your guy of course, but your spouse is in @LOCATION2 and you couldn't them. Well computers these days have webcams. So now @CAPS2 you really need to talk to him or her you can by using webcam. So readers of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. Can you see now why I believe that having computers around is good. @CAPS1 helps students do there school work. @CAPS1 gives the ability to learn about far away places and countries. @CAPS1 also gives the change to talk to people with webcams.

Computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. Some people say that computers are a bad influence on @LOCATION1. I think other wise. I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. If it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. Take microsoft @CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. If you want to chat, then you can use @CAPS2 or instant messaging. This allows you to type and sent emails faster. Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. Like lets say my dad goes on business to @LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. Here is one example: my older brother @PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He is in school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. I think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. Computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like...

I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!

Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but

You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them. In my opinion, I find computers to be a very negative influence on yound kids, teens, and adults. Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one. For one thing, people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to excercise and take care of themselves. Also to, the only nature they're experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beuty of what we have left of out earth. Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones. What happened to our society? Why can't we think on our own anymore? I truely, strongly hope that what i'm saying will change the minds of some people. Thank you very much. Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone's life. Especially growing kids and teens. On the computer what exercise benefits are you getting? Stronger fingers? A higher chance of syndrome @CAPS10. "@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids having @CAPS7 problems like obesity have access to the internet", accoding to @PERSON2 of the, "@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6" in hunington beach, @LOCATION1. When basically, your giveing youself to the computers, you @MONTH1 not have any thoughts at all of staying fir. Instead on some chips while typing. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 BENEFITS @CAPS8 that game help? With global warming by ourside, what you saw yesterday @MONTH1 not be there today. Breathing in some fresh, natural air can really calm a stressed child out. What ever happened to playing an endless scoth with side walk chalk and fresh? or tag or just running around? Is it not cool anymore? Yah, not cool to take care of yourself. Inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or draw a screnary. Now a days, instead of @CAPS10 climing a tree, were climbing our mouse arrow to the next website. There's so much that we all take for granted, that one day when you look back on ti all, youre going to really miss those @DATE1 days. Family time is so critical in anyone's life. Without a family, you're nothing. When did game night or family time disapear? Just because we're in a society that says computers are completely normal everyday thing in a house, doesn't mean you family and friends aren't a main priority to you anymore. If you want to hangout a friend's house, dont email about it, walk @CAPS2 there and get the full affect since when does a computer a family? Never. If we got out of a fake reality, @CAPS10 there wouldn't be negativity in our life. @CAPS10 you can regain a true life back with them. @CAPS10 you'd think more clearer just @CAPS10. Whats makes a computer any better than life? Nothing ask yourself that. So inconclusive, I strongly believe that with this in you lives we've actually get dumber. There's more negative than positives in having a computer. Sure you could quickly send them a message or like @CAPS9, but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling? Or sendin letter? I say again, thank you for taking out your time to read this. @CAPS10 i changed you, @CAPS10 not. Whatever you do, think about the next time you're online and see what happends.

Dear local newspaper, I do agree that computers have impacted human society greatly. Therefore, my opinion is that is @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions. I would say this because there are different help programs or websites that @MONTH1 help people in everyday life. Especially students have the ability to study from education webpages. Also, people are able to communicate online. Lastly, you are able to type stories instead of hand-writing them. Having the advantage to study online is great. Different websites with tons of information and true facts @MONTH1 really affect grades of most students. Did you know about @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 go on educational websites for information for writing, whether it's an essay or non-fiction story? Thanks to computers, there is a great chance students @MONTH1 receive a passing grade. Communication online has made huge impact worldwide. Whether you use facebook, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 etc., communicating with family or friends is fantastic. For example, I use facebook and I love talking to my family down in @LOCATION2, whom I see about once every couple years. Online communication has affected people because there is an easier way to talk to other instantly. Just a push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. Finally, people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story. For instance, if you use microsoft word, you can type up whatever you want. This has effected people because it is a faster ans easier way to write. Therefore, if you finish earlier than you would have if you typed it, you would have extra leisure time, or more time to get the rest of your work done. Also, it is easy for me because I type like the wind; after practice, of course. In conclusion, the invention of computers helped and still do help society in many ways. But, the three ways that i have chosen to tell you about in this letter, I feel, have impacted us the most. I hope this helps you with you questions about how computers effected people. Thank you for taking time to read my letter. Have a good day.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a computer isn't harmful in any way. It helps people learn about things they didn't know. Also it lets people interact with people around the world. Another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe. Computers don't harm, they help. Computers are a learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education. Anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other machines were built by computers which supplied the blueprints. There is one thing computers are mostly used for, and thats to learn. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but don't know how things work around there? Well a computer can help you with those promblems. It lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour. Even with some assistance if you don't know about traditions or beliefs. Computers are a great way to explore. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Family members that live on the otherside of the world can use computers to talk and see how your doing. How about old friends that moved away. You can still talk and communicate with each other. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't all that bad is it? And these are reason to show how computers aren't harmful in anyway. It gives people a good education. It lets people learn about cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something thats good, not bad. This is why computers don't harm people, they help.

Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well i think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps make learning about other countries easier. Also, it helps people talk to people from different countries. Another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures, religions, or traditions. The reason why some peope think that computers have a negative effect on people is because people are spending more time on the computer than spending time with their family. Also, people use the computer more than they use exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters. Now that you know about the positive and negative effects of computers, Which side will you choose? the one against computers or the one for computers. I would choose the one for computers.

Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion.

Dear Newspaper, The question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not. In my opinion people aren’t, and there are many benefits from being on the computer. Typing in the computer teacher hand-eye coordination. It is easy to learn while on computer too, and you all communicate with people also! Handeye coordination is very important. We use it everyday during sports taking notes, even playing video games! Being on the computer is good because it develops hand-eye coordination. Whatever you do on the computer typing, playing online game, or surfing the web develop hand-eye coordination. It is good to learn hand-eye coordination because most teachers these days neat children to type and print their papers, so they are neater.If kids can learn hand-eye coordination, they can type faster turn then into their when go on there computer hand-eye coordination. My world cultures teacher lets us use an online textbook if we dont finished our homework in class, instead of logging around textbook. Any student would rather go online than have to bring a giant textbook to and from school. Have you ever thought about how much easier it is college course online. Then having to go to college especially for working parents? Everything happens online in you portable laptop, instead of having to go to and from a college. Using computer to learn about different places is easy. There are websites full of pictures of beautiful foreign places that hot deserts, and troppical rainfall of monkeys and tigers. It is fun and easy to learn on a computer. Since cell phones have become so a lot of people have gotten rid of thier home phone to save money. Sometimes, though cellphones lose signal. That is why it is good to have a computer. It is eat to talk to other people forums, chats websites and email. You can have intelligent,and its easy and free! It is east to communicate using a computer. Surely you've heard my reasons its okay for people to spend time on the computer you see my point. Yes people shall spend time outside or with family, in small does the computer good for you. It is easy to learn hand coordination and communicate on a computer.

Not everyone thinks computers are good for you but they are a very good resorce to find information. It's not good to be on the compoler @NUM1 seven but to be on sometimes is not bad. A person who is on the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Dont over due it! Computers are also very good for information as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something they could go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need. So computers have very good qulities and resources. They arnt bad or unhealthy unless if that is your life and that is the only thing you do. That is my opinion on computers.
<START>

I think that people are spending a lot of time on there computers and not enjoying nature and things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and they site around eating junk and no exercise. Those are my three reasons. My first reason is people do is surf the web. There is over a million websites to go to. What people do is go to all of them look at things or buy something. The only thing they should be doing is homework or buisness. Also people play to many video games on the computer too. My second reason is that people go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours talking to people. Sometime those things are peoples life and all they do. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 and after school all they do is talk to people. They have friends on @CAPS1 but no friends in real life. My third reason is when people do go on all they do is eat junk food and get no exercise. Sometimes they eat potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for week you will be very tired and sleepy. Also you can get very fat. Your body will be unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you like them. My reasons where people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exersize, go out doors. And have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do theis things. My first reason was exersizeing. And the reason why I say exersizeing is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides. I mean it's ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that's why they have books, and school to learn about things. My second reason was going out-side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn with-out being on the computer. For once maby insed of talking online you can actultly go to your friends house and talk. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 your at home and you are on the computer. But its been hours maybe even days since you've takin a breath of fresh air outside. This @MONTH1 sound cpzy, yet it is a reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Just loo around they are in movies, chain resurant at your home, in your office and even in schoold; computers are everywhere. I know that because of over using computers amny experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, I say that because of this peopel every where shold only be allowed to use the computer on a rain everday, say @CAPS2 to computers. My point is with computers our days are wasted with vertual games and other downloads. For starter, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Over the past two years obeseity has become a major issue in @LOCATION1 with over @PERCENT1 of the population obeseity causesan ectreamly higher risk of getting diseases and sickness like diabeaties, heart failure and even depression. recently my cousin passed away from canser caused by her fat or obeseity. My point is we can't sit her doing nothing get up and get moving away from that computer in addition to this people should get off computers and start enjoying nature. A total of <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of personals in @LOCATION1 don't spend enough time out side. With global warning killing our environment people would care enouhg to psend a little girl of their time outside. didi you know that more and more of the environment is disappering each day? I went to my good friends and expert on all things envieronmental from the instate of clean our world or cow. 
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies, such as computers have an humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net. Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, fo for a bike ride or something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. "@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings." says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers because "before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M Computers help people lose communication and interaction with fmily and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end, I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing you today so you can see why advanced technology is a positive effect on people. My reasons for wrint this is because computers allow people to talk online to others people learn about faraway places, and finally it teacher hand-eye coordination. As you read my letter I hope you fell the same way. First of all computers allow you to talk to other people online. The reason I feel this way is what if you can't fond your fone in your hose or even your cell phone, you could see if they were online. Also its the same thing as texting, but with a bigger keyboard/screen I can relate to this because I was texting someone and went online to find whtm on too, so we sent aims to each other instead. I hope you can see why computers can be good for people. Secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school. The reason I feel this way is a computer has google to make finding things easier. Another reason is going to the library @MONTH1 cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks. I can relate this because everytim my family goes to the library we have to fill the car up after we go. This is another reasons why computers a good. Finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination. The reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch. Another reasons why computers are hand-eye coordination is because if your kid take karayta then might have learned to move there hands that fast from somewhere. I can relate ti this because when I was in the first grade there was a guy that you told me and my friends that be need us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy, and he tried grabbing me but I pulled my hard away before I became pinned. I hope you can see why we need computers. I would like to that the I for sitting and reading my essay. Once again my reasons for writing where people can talk to other people online, learn about faraway places, and finally hand-eye coordination. I hpoe you will rethink why we should have computers in school.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Continue reading to find out why. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We @MONTH1 not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fix it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need on sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them are the quick way to learn that skill. Next, how many student's parents work? My parents do. Something it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 it up, you might even get more information, then what you can get in the library. Hows that? you ask. Well, for an example, @CAPS1 you had to do a project on @CAPS2. Let's just say, you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough, on a survey @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skils. When I first moved here I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3, I @CAPS4 talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person, and use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 and communicate. @CAPS9 I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you know them a little, then when you talk in person you will see you have alot in common, with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another thing, that is somewhat related to this. I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS9 over. We @CAPS9 know, you can't travel @CAPS9 the time, sometimes you can't even get to see them. Thats @CAPS10 social networks help. You can keep in touch, plus @CAPS11.S. not even waste minutes on you phone. Can it get better? In conclusion, Computers have a very positive effect on people. From improving hand-eye coordination, to not stepping out to go to the library, and getting that project done in time with a A+ as a grade, to improving your socia skills. Even see the data collected. Thank you for taking your time and effort to read this, I hope it has persuaded many people.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win. Plus, they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, secend pick out your book, and third check @CAPS1 out. with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I @CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone @CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to @CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't @CAPS3 about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortanitly she doesn't even live anywhere close to @NUM1 hours to me. She's way down @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. By car thats one and a half days and by plane thats three hours! So @CAPS1's so much easier to log on @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 being at home with nothing to do. You cant play basketball with @PERSON1 you friends because you have did hand eye cordenation. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there arnt any books. And you want to talk to your friends. That’s what would have happend if we dident have advances in technology. No handeye cordenation, we wouldent be able to learn about far way places and we coudent online. Ccomputers benifit our lives in so many ways. To begin with, hand eye cordenation is very important. Without @CAPS5 we woudent be able to ware or even hold a pensil. @PERCENT1 of peoples hand eye cordenation has emproved when using a computer. That was proven in a @DATE1 say a @CAPS2 by @PERSON2, head of human reactions. “@CAPS3 knows that your hands are the most oversized part of you body, the computer help down the movements to hone hand eye cordenation.” – @PERSON1 said that in a @DATE2 interview with sience magaziene. When you are clumsy you break things. Importan things sumtimes, like @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mothers glass vase. @CAPS5 could have been helped if she had used a computer. In addition, computers give us the power to learn about faraway places. No books! @PERCENT2 of people prefer looking up information on a computer than in a book. @CAPS5’s a fact. Some people wouldent have heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if @CAPS5 wasent for the websights that brodcasted updates on @CAPS5. Campers weudent have heard. In @ORGANIZATION2 had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books. Books could be outdated but the computer will always have uptodate answers. Also, people need to be able to talk online. Bisness meetings, governments plans, to just chatting with a friend. People need to be able to stay in tuch. If the presedent couldent vidio conference he would be flying everyware. Emale is the only way @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 talks to her coworkers. “ I just am located so far away, its so much easier.” @CAPS5 makes bissnesses and major incoperations flow.”@CAPS6 is now the only way kids talk @CAPS5 seems.” @PERSON4 says. @CAPS5 lets them feel like there a part of somthing biger then they are. Now, @CAPS1 happy, healthy, and educated young and old amaricans. They can do and research whatever they want. Its amazing what technology does. @CAPS5 alows you to talk online research faraway places, and practice your handeye cordenation. That sounds like a good thing to me! So @ORGANIZATION1, computeristic fist are only good. So agree with me @ORGANIZATION1!

Some people @MONTH1 think that computers take up too much time for the important things. But really everything you would like to know is right there. You can learn about nature, cool websites even history. Here are my reasons on the effect on computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many types of animals and study them. Learn about plant and the effect they have on life. Also, you can learn about many things on @LOCATION1 and how its changing. Secondly, there are many coll websites you can join. Theres games you can play to keep you occupied during the day. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long lost friends. School sites are available for students of some studying or help. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. People who things and world famous people from back then compared to famous people now. Most important of all, the life changing story about and how it changes peoples life today. I hope I've you enough to agree with me. As you can see computers have many resources you can learn from learning websites and history arent even half of them. Think about! Thank you for listening
<START>

Computers and the @CAPS1 have changed the way the world works today. From stocks to instant messaging (@CAPS2) people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read. Although some people believe that computers are pulling people away from the beauty of nature, relatives, or exersize. I believe that @CAPS11 is only helping the world on a day today basis. One example is conversation, many people have close relatives that but over seas, cross country, or even across town. The @CAPS1 helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. On several occasions, my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent. What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the @CAPS1. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a website that allows you to speak to, @CAPS6 or send pictures to others. Other websites like this are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reason, is @CAPS6. Multiple servers proud @CAPS6. such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. "@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite' says @PERSON2 @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper, "@CAPS11 has helped me endlessly if need to contact someone on short notice." That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. "Even though I still use books," college student, @PERSON1 said."The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up to date. Search @CAPS13 are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com @NUM2, of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have @ORGANIZATION1 at some paint. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used from everything to research papers to. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complain that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life. Such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. As for exersise, @CAPS11 is commonsense to spend as little as one hour working on personal fitness.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, @NUM1 int's not good for people's health, @NUM2 people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and @NUM3 you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: @CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, @CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour @CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore @CAPS3 I right, I think I @CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) @CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and @NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right.

@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this @CAPS3 in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to ee whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye @CAPS1 greatly. Studys do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand eye @CAPS1 then some one who dosen't. Coumputers help hand eye @CAPS1 and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said I heard some one at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts." This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said "@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye cordniation, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people. Computers are a great thing for everyone."

Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Computers hold many opertunities for the world and… we don't use any of them. Computers have taken many and left them without excersize. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 years old in a @NUM1 year old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. Don't make the same mistake as me readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend name @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stoped my addiction before it got to serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous and read this is, "@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are the devils tools. They will most certainly destroy you, readers. Alway be careful, computers are not as they seem.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of ten people spend their time on the computers. I believe people should not spend @CAPS3 much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes. They @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos or pictures. Lastly, their bills will get higher. Did you know a lot of people spend their time on the computers? Well I think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes. When you sit and watch computer your eyes starts to hurt. Then when you go to check your eyes, the doctor will probably give a glasses. My second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos. One time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos @CAPS3 when her father found out about this, he canceled their internet. Can you imagine the high bills you would get? Why pay too much money for spending @CAPS3 much time in the computer, when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends. For example, instead of sitting on the computer @CAPS3 much, go outside and play soccer, kickball and more. In conclusion, people should stop spendinding @CAPS3 much time on the computers. Computers can hurt your eyes if you sit too much. People @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos. Also your bills will get higher. It seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers. I hope you are agree with my ideas.

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three reasons. First, they help people learn by looking up information on different places. Second, the help people talk to friends and family using @CAPS2. Lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games. Learning is important and with computers, you're able to learn faster. Computers help you learn about faraway places like @LOCATION1. It is much easier to learn on the computer than to go to the library and check out a book. If you're working on a project and you needed some last minute information, you could just go to the computer and search you're topic. Learning on a computer is much more convenvent then going to the @CAPS1. Another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called @CAPS2. @CAPS2 allows someone to talk to another person using the computer. These people could live just down the block or half-way accrose the world. My cousin is living in spain for a semester in college. I've skped with her many times. The cool thing about @CAPS2 is that you can acctually see the person you're talking to on the computer screen. @CAPS2 is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway. My last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games. Computer games are alot of fun to play. They have games that range from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word, to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are a great way to lower your stress because instead of piking your self up with to much work, you'll be calming your selfdown with computer games. They also gave educational games. like, Which country is which. This game teaches you geoagrahy while you have fun. Computers are a great thing to have. They help you learn about faraway places, talk to people who live faraway and play fun computer games. Computers are always going to be used and never put to waste. Theres always something you can do when you go on a computer.

Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. First, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses trouble, in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @DATE1 people in the @LOCATION1, do bad stuff like starting rumors, & saying bad stuff about people they dispise, in the @DATE1, @PERCENT2 @DATE1 teens form ages @NUM1 were envolven with the rumor spreading. This would be bad for all children. All these reasons will lead to the @NUM2 below. Secondly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses voilence, because @DATE1 the reasons started in the @NUM3 paragraph, if all this continues, then it @MONTH1 & lead to voilence, in @DATE1 @NUM4 people died from all the crimes online. @NUM5 threats were found online from big websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 & @CAPS3. Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In @DATE3 a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @CAPS4 on a website online, a group @DATE1 men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops. Thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime In conclusion, I am concenred that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. This @CAPS5 like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for your time in reading this letter

Dear Readers, Everyone now-a-days has a computer. This could be a good thing but mostly its unnatral. People can now do things they couldn't do before; when people move they don't need to send letters to one another, and have to wait days for a reply. Now they just sign into aim, facebook, or myspace. Then they can talk in time. But thats only the good things here are the bad. People spend less time outside they don't look at any of the butey anymore. We don't spend time with our friends any more. I can't even remember the last time I had a face to face convetation with soemone if I didn't have to. People on the internet can do anything they want. You @MONTH1 be saying thats a good thing. Right? Well the answer is no! People can hack into almost everything. People can cyber bully others with out any one ever knowing who the other person is. People can also be any one they want online. Say if I was @NUM1 and I wanted to stalk so little @NUM2 years old I could also pretend that I was ten and pretend make friends with the ten year old. When I found out enough information I would then be able to find the ten year old. Before people wern't able to do this. If people start to see what is heppening with our exsistence the more people would stop being stached @NUM3 to their computers. People would start to cut down on the amount of time they spend on their computers and start to live. Take action! Take notice! Start spreding the word!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 would you want to do in your spare time? Would you go outside and maybe @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? The question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers have a negative effect. Talking to friends on the computer doesn't let you learn social skills. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I @CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. When you first meet someone in person, you most likely want to @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. @CAPS6 not invite someone over, or go out to lunch with your family istead? Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. This is the case for many other people too. Going on the computer is addicting. Il @CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone @CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact @CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. I @CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people find the clicking and clacking of computers a nuscense. What they don't realize is thay are helping the youths lives and making them easier and they could be doing the same for them. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off computers arn't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ad's for dating websites and other things like that. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. Thats a lot and to think they would have never if it wern't for computers. Second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 on computer games online. @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before. Think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well computers arn't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they benefit adults in many ways too. It provides information on vacations, hotels, ext. Also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information. So as you can see computers arn't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day. Computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours.
<START>

Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these "computer geeks" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. "Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much," @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. "@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own." This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. "Everyone is already online." @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. "@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world.

Many people think that computers are not a good thing. They think people spend to much time on the computer and are getting less exercise. They are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes. Those statements maybe true. I believe that computers are beneficial. You can talk to people from other places. You could learn about other places in the world. You can also use the computer to research topics. first off, on the computer you can talk to people. Whether it on a webcam or one of those networks to @LOCATION1 and chat with each other. On the computer you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it. For example, I have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer. We talk on webcam and chat. Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive. If I didn't have a computer then I would not have that great of contact with @CAPS2 family from another country. In addition, You can use the computer to look at foreign countries. Many people including @CAPS2 parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries. @CAPS2 mother, whenever @CAPS1 plans a vacation, looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it. Like @DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place, @CAPS2 mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there. If it weren't for the computer we might have packed the wrong items. Lastly, computers are a great source for researching. I can't tell you how many times I have used the computer to research. Books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer. You have so many links you can go to and sites. You can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have used the computer many times to research, sometimes its a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something. If you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school. Computers are a more positive thing than negative. You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill. You can learn about other places and cultures. Also, you can use it for researching purposes. Computers @CAPS3!
<START>

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.

Dear newspaper people I think computers are good because wat if I have a family member that gose out of town and you want to stay in tuch and I dont have a phone then I can go-on a chatting web sight and stay in with them. When @CAPS1 bored I go on google to look up and pichers and play some games. You can look up one think and find something elsa, but it will cech your eyes. Computers are good were ever you go, it can look up for a project for school. Bur ween you are in school it can help you with spelling, and if u got to know wat contrey has the most people the @CAPS2 will find the ancer as fast as a snap. Computers are advanceing every year. Seart the @CAPS2 was just a screan and a mouse, now we got laptops that you can tack every were. People can get exercis if thay want and thay can enjoy nature thay can bring a laptop. But when you are exercising then you can go right to youtube and lison to some musick and wach funny videos. And thats whay I think computers are good.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three of them: @CAPS4 theft, cyberbully, addition. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is. @CAPS4 theft many people in the @CAPS5.S.A identities get stolen for listing private information online (computer) which can leave that person in a lot of debt. How are we going to encourage people to use computers when their at the risk of getting their @CAPS4 stolen. If this happening to innocent people it needs to stop we must'nt encourage this online behavior so say no to computers. i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen, met in person they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their enjoyment. It has been proven that when children even adults get cyberbullied can lead them in the path of depression even suicide. Now I find it quite febble-minded to give up your life for a computer. So again I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers when eventually lead to the division from friends and family because your lost in the computer world also you forget about you hygene some people even forget to eat. This thing they call computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and bring you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have gave you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do which were because @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, addiction. Say no @NUM1 computers.
<START>

Dear Newspaper I strongly agree with experts on computer's. Those who support advances in technology believe that computer's have a positive effect on people. They say that computers teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn from faraway places and even allow people to talk with others online. Theese effects are true but there are many other bad effects to that they dont like to say. Computers also effect people's visiion as you are really close to the screen, computers are really addicting for many people all around the world and having them do bearly no excercize moving many people to a big problem now n days which is obesity. Computer's also tend to take a lot of time away from people's lives. The way I see it to is that although computer's have some positive effects on people you can change those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit to and seeing places with your eyes, like you can get practice with hand-eye coordination by simply getting a friend and pass tennis balls back and forth quick so at the same time your exercizing to. Also a computer can have you talk with your friends online but why not talk to them by phone if there far away n go outside and catch some fresh air n if they live close by why not talk to them in person instead. or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead. There are many things you can do that a computer can do and better. but yet im not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion to I honestly think there are more bad effects then good effects for computer's.
<START>

I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is bacause they are spenfing more time on them then exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercis on it's still better then going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people should't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via comuter, it still wan't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people waould spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer. We would be living in a much more healthy and clean word. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they covered he spending quality time with their friends and family, instead they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends then spending more time on the computer. even if you don't spend alot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it everyday until eventually it's all you do.

Dear @CAPS1, This a letter telling you my opinion about computer. Yes people do spend that time in computers a lot, its because computers are very helpful in many ways. Computers help us with our job, school, work ect. For example science. Im in @NUM1 grade. My teacher @PERSON1 gives us homework; every @DATE1, we have to do @ORGANIZATION1 are @NUM2 facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears on @ORGANIZATION2 and they do their assigment about bears. Jobs; secreatenes always have to use computer for everything in our school secreaterys and teachers use computers for attendance, grading. They check you, attendance, grade, phone number and schedule. Communication, my dad the computer wuth our family from @LOCATION1. We talk to know how they've been, to know whats new. Like a week ago I was chating to my cousin she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies. My family also uses the computer, to order. My uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for wwe. He also orders his flight tickets in his computer, to go to @LOCATION1. Well my point is people use computer a lot because they are, very helpful in many ways. Its not good to just be in the computer it good to outside enjoy nature live your life exercise not only to be in shape, but for your health. @CAPS1 hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers. Thank you for taking your time and reading I really appreciate it.

Dear local @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, latly I have been noticing that some of the citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 have been using computers and laptops for a good amount of three the some people to the say @CAPS2 is a waste of time they could enjoying with family and friends with friends and family far away. @CAPS2 helps with research and learn @ORGANIZATION1 thnigs and @CAPS2 help with relaxing people. modern time and the people who disagree enjoy Some family and friends lives far away and you cant talk to them in person. There is always calling them or writing them a letter hot email, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are easier and to use. When you call you dont know if your them there phones bissy, or they a bad @CAPS2 takes long and you @CAPS2 better to stay and send on and know you didn't @CAPS2 helps in advertisment and sales. Sometimes maybe unrealible because anybody can change anything on the site. Not all things online are like that though. Stay away from scares and things, they will came Some people find the internet @CAPS2 could be there from work or sites. There are fun games and to talk to In research the internet helps @PERCENT1 of people relax and calm down after a long @CAPS5, when on the computer or laptop which helps with stress. Computers can help in many ways. There are other realiable things. Plus where ever you go you will find the internet.

Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. "I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day," @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. "@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent," @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. "@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other," says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You mcan e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if. you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps 'me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out 'everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. i use the computer for mostly everything I do. Comming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other ;people, and get imformation on places you want to visit somebody. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this.

Dear @CITY1 current I am writing to you on the issue about people spending to much time on computers and not able to spend time with other people like family, friends and others. Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage. Another reason is that people are truning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exerising and getting to get some freish air. To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example let's say that your friends are planing on going to yhis huge beach party that every one is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but beofre they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not  for them they pass on by you don't go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party. SO that is any story , it might seen long so, I'm shorting the next part which is the information on computer. Foe example lets say that you  doing on  paper you  . Just need youre more . You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computres are good. For some  reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason myspace, facebook other its good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good, what matters is there you need to be haapy. I think  done all I could. So thoses are my reason why computer are good and bad  for reasch bad because of nooding to exericis and need to be with friends

I believe computers are a benefit to society. Computers help hand eye cordination they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat. Computers teach hand eye cordination when typing and eventually you get so good you dont ever have to look down at the keyboard. you can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before. Maybe you want to go on vaction to another country and can't decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countrys to decide which are you want to go to. If you are on vaction or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer. Those are the reasons why I think that computers are a benifit to our society.

Dear editor, Have you ever would to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an"ah-hah!" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit " enter" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and learn lots!

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for @CAPS3, and it provides information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's @CAPS3! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also @CAPS3! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are @CAPS2 websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for @CAPS3! There's one player, two player, and party . This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone on in and have a time. Also, computers could be for fun and your used for work. The @CAPS2 information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Either you're doing research on a project, , or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for @CAPS3! In conclusion, computers are useful for @CAPS2 things and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do. As you can see, computers impoved the lives of @CAPS2 human beings.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I Computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many things like help you learn something new and see new/old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for there education. There are online college and online high school. Its like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big @CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends. I friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With computer you can now send a letter faster then before. Its now called an email. Which you just type what you want and click..send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be aim or meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! chat and see them. For instance @ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that. Its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids them even teens and adults love. Whenever your bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchesed and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great and there are pently of more things you can do other than what I was taking about. I hope I have convinced I or showed you how computers are a benifit to us people.

According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, "the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved." @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer.
<START>

I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. @NUM1? Of @CAPS1 will agree they spend at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computer. Which is unneccessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of @CAPS3. And who is the #@NUM3 cul? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of @CAPS3. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much @CAPS3 are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. @PERCENT1 inf will agree that with more @CAPS3, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer overexercise and it them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talknig to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to the them. Online there is much more which often break up friendship. Also, online you new people or make as many new friends. @CAPS2 you go and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't wants families become would you? Well, this is one of the many effects the @CAPS2 members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading in separation or devorce. This could make a child have in decide between a whole family to @CAPS3, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the use of computers before it is too late.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friend is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important.

Dear local newspaper, I also agree that computers have a positive effect on people. I agree with this because the computer can teach people things. Also people can talk to each other, and believe / create whatever they want. Computer have a positive effect on people because i believe the computer can teach people a lot. The computer can make things visual to kids and out. I know that when i was younger i used to play math and science games on the computer to help me study for tests. The computer also helps out with adults and their jobs. I don't know what half the adults in the world would do without computers. If you think about all jobs that are happening today also @CAPS1 of the computer. Such as e-mail. What would some buisnesses do. without e-mail? also adults like to check websites for the news and to catch upon sports. we can all learn so much from the computer and there are so many people who @CAPS1 their jobs on computer. we all learn something everyday and with the computer, we can make it kind. Also the computer benefits online chats e-mail and now even with a cam you can talk face to face with people all over the world I know e-mail helps out so many people who live long distance and e-mail doesn't take long at all. I know thanks to cam and microphones that are buit into computer helped our because now I can talk to all my friends and family and see them I hear them without traveling just simply clicking a button. There are websites now that @CAPS1 of taveing to @NUM1 people online and over cam or microphone. Things like this help out so much somepeople just. Think about all those people who have relationships and what not, @CAPS1 it off of computers really do help out. Lastly all the people who @CAPS1 their imagination off computers, all those people who put that thoughts and feelings into the computer. I know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud. Now imagine if computers faded away? That's what i think about what people say such things as the computers not. Everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out or it. So @CAPS2 in my opinion computers do bring out a positive effect to the world.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computer's are good to use? More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits soceiety I srong disagree. My first reason is because computer's are not safe. My second reason is computer's could get you in a lot of troble. My @CAPS3 reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First @CAPS4 gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computer's are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live at then what? Second - computer's could get you into a lot of trobe such as posting things online or saying mean thing's to people. Next computer's are bad because if someone like's you and you say I dont like you they could post mean and hurt full thing's and then if you friend's see it you will probably get mad. Finally - in concusion thease are all my reason's why I think computer's are not good. You never know what coud happen on a computer there's website's there and some could start a virus on your computer. Also I think computer's are not good because computer's lead to no good so keep your child away from computers. Also be careful what chu @CAPS2.

I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades. Where when we are done with are gaine we whatch a little t.v.. then go to sleep to regain our energy we usually have atleast @NUM2 hrs. of sleep ever @DATE1 which lets us make it through school. We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1. If can lead to and relly bad grades. @CAPS2 if you want your kids healthier, better grades, and spend more time with your family then ethier sell your computer or This is happening all over the world.

Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have.
<START>

Some of you @MONTH1 agree that computers don't keep you fit or we spend too much time on them but, they can help you keep in touch with friends and family, meet new people, and save information. Without these important technology devices we wouldn't be able to do any of these things. Most families live all over the country @MONTH1 be even in another country, and you don't get to see them very often because of traveling prices, however with the computer they can help us keep in contact with them very easy and quicker than you can say "@LOCATION1." @CAPS1 more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all sites that you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover @CAPS1 people with the same interest as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites. Without these sites there might be less divorces and more happy ending fairy tales. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people work out home. It's good and you can get things done the. Many people have papers and of important information and it could be lost in a blink of an eye. With technology like this they save with just a click of that mouse. More buisnesses are being held at their households because of this easy going technology. Exercise @MONTH1 be important still, with a touch of a button I could talk to my aunt, find the right one for me and save my whole life. New technology like computers can change the world and help @MONTH1 things faster.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise and I also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too. @CAPS1 three reasons for @CAPS1 opinion is @NUM1. People are not getting enough exercise, @NUM2. People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time, @NUM3. They will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it's kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen. One time I did that and @CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer. The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak. The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change, the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind. The next thing you you wont have a freind anymore. The third detail is that it's like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer thats something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says "first I got to beat this level." @CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and thats like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good. The third detail is you will began to hate the person because the person dosen't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain @CAPS1 opinion on the compter fact in the news paper I read.

Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing. Whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time excersising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays with all the great advances in technology, peoples are always glued to computer screens. Lets face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do and when we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like excersising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day is obese. The cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, the do not want to go to the gym or anything. Another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education. This also cuts down on their excersise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness, they are enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti-social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer but then when you used them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer. Also, they have lost their abilities to interact in real life. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts. Most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad. This strain only lead to unpleasant things. For example, if you we addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken and over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses. Another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see. Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed, that's what happens to people who use their computers too long. Local newspaper, you @MONTH1 think that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever, the you are right, however you shouldn't use it too much.
<START>

As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around, that if all the computers in the world were to "break," then most people probably would not know how to @CAPS2. Like the basic theory of. Which was that the world was "@CAPS1" to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end. Only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way to much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to @CAPS2, a lot of people "forget" to excersise! Our body needs excersise to live. Excersise one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an "innocent" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on "youtube." The way you want to live your life is up to you. And I hope to @CAPS3 that you start living it healthier.

Over one million people on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves staying on to long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get excercise dont use the computer if needed. People become overweight also. I think people should do something els then use the computer. One main effect that see is many people play the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything. But many of us will. We can be the huge dangerous preditors going for the prey. If there is something els to do besides play the computer do it. If you know your over weight from the computer. You!! Can make a change. If you keep doing other activities you can get skinny again easily. You just gotten make that type of change. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer useage. The way isee it is if we make a chart then we will know when to get off and twhen to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it infront of them. This could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work. This is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinon people shouldn't be on the computer or more then @NUM1 hours to @NUM2 hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing. The nature and wildlife is much more important. The effects on the computer puts on us can vary. If its not to overweight to not spending time with families, to doing schoolwork. You need to use your time wisely.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend to much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes, to a half an hour. But one hour or more, is too long. People could get sucked in by playing adicting games. Also by online chatting survices like facebook, myspace, instant messaging, and more. Another way, I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it lost minute. These are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and its an hour later? Games are very adicting. you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by. Games are very fun, but they fry your brain. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think, we should eliminate some games off the internent, so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends, not playing silly games. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half? And that you have homework? @PERCENT3 of teenages on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internent. Facebook, myspace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carryied away. I think, we shoud cut down out use on these websites, so children and teenagers can get their homework done. Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due. They then, are stuck on the internent for hours trying to get it done. Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlyier. @PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports, on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their report earlyier so it could bring up their grades. In conclusion i believe people have spent way to much time using computers, due to games, internent chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we elimate games off the internent, cut down use on internent chatting, and start reports earlyier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done and get higher grades.

Do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are for away is ggod? With a computer these are some things that you will be able to do. Being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good. Some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them. @CAPS1 the people we have sent to @ORGANIZATION1 they have a Family here and I have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them. Also if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere a computer can help pass the time, @CAPS1 the people that live in the @CAPS2 they can get alot of snow during the winter time and @MONTH1 have to stay inside. So if they have a computer they are able to do things @CAPS1 play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time. Another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything. You are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up. Some kids do have some trouble with some homework but can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is suppose to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that you did not do it. There are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people. By being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending alot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quility time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interraction with other human beings face to face. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hatefull and vulgar messages to their enemys without showing their face. In some cases some teens were harrased online so bad they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a " meeting place" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live. Internet usage needs to be cut down to sites. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen.

Dear editor, @CAPS1 do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day. My friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers. This just isn't healthy for our envierment and people. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 time. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good excersice ruinte. They say that all the junk kids and grown-ups acumulate in their daily life is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up. They also say that without excersice our country will be filled with over weight people. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you. @PERSON1 has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature but, no their sitting in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer which is not good for them. He's taught people that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 the time if you get out and have fresh air your life will be so much better. My mom has had experience with computers and asures me that when she was younger you couldn't just sit there and not get out. She says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship. Talking to your family will keep them intact with @CAPS1's going on in your life and hanging out with your friends will help with having more @ORGANIZATION1 a life without your household. She says any kid who does sit in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day should be disappointed @ORGANIZATION1 themsleves. Editor you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! So, I feel that if you stress the point in your next newspaper about not having computers all the time you should always excersice like my friends say, the research as taught to enjoy your nature and my mother says to interact with your family and friends. I'm sure your next article will be a wonderful dream to people stating facts.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have effected people in a very positive way. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology gets higher and people can acess much more things. Computers are good because they are convinent, and provide entertainment. Have you ever wanted to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is, or what the weather is in @LOCATION2? To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convient, that whenever you have a question about anything, you can use the computer! Take my cousing courthey, for example, everyday, her teacher asigns definitions for homework. So, she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary. However, @PERSON4 isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convinent. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something the computer is the most convinent item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, "@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convinent to everyone." In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and your bored, what do you do? How about go on the computer! The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether its listening to music, playing games, or talking with friends, you will always have fun on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so, she goes on the computer and plays games, and talk with friends. @PERSON3 can also talk to her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, that live in @LOCATION1. But, @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, "The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults." @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of enteratinment, would you? After school, many teens and adults go rushing to the computers for all different reasons. But, in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convinence, and great sources of entertainment.

To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of the sudden you are talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that i haven't seen since we was little and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. If not for computers this program wouldn't have been as succesful and beneficial as @CAPS5 has become. Also, is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5 quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. When i am bored i sometimes go on, and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the @CAPS2 communicate, Who knows that computers will help us accomplish next?

Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that for too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying "@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch"? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you . It is shown that @PERCENT1 of strints who read . Not the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing reply .

Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand eye cordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important. Next, computers teach hand eye ncordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up. So you call an electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newpapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now lets say that one of your employess just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so she isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see computers are very important. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand eye cordination and let people neet new people online.

Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps their education,you can talk to family and friends, and you can get better hand-eye corrdination. Read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect. @CAPS4 first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education. I mean come on, how many college students do you see without a laptop? You see none. Am I right? You always need a computer because you have to type eveything, and do research for big essay papers. People think "we'll, there's always the library?" @CAPS1 your wrong. @CAPS4 local library closes at @TIME1 pm. I'm sure college students are yo way later than @TIME1 doing homework. Just imagine, late at night, @NUM1 pm, no library, no computer, and a giant essay due tomorrow. What are you going do? @CAPS1, you better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes! @CAPS2, even if you did go to the library, who wants to log all of your books down stairs, and drive to the library and then finally get there and realize you forgot something. Thats just a waste of time! Next, computers are positve because you can talk to your friends and family. For one it saves a load of money because email doesn't cost anything! I have a @ORGANIZATION1! email and I don't pay a cent for it! With a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month. Did you know the average american spends atleast #@NUM2 each month on cellphones? It's out @CAPS2, what if you never see a certain family member? I know @CAPS4 cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. So, she got a webcam, and now everyday they talk, and her dad gets to see the baby. They think the they always talk about everything day, and other things. After, I have just said all these wonderful things, you look someone in the eyes and then than that computer don't help people. For @CAPS4 final reason, computers are positive because you could gain hand-eye corrdination, @CAPS4 brother, @PERSON1, loves, and I mean obssesive love, loves video games. He's addicted to them! He can't stop playing them, and I dont mind at all. I dont mind because now he can chew gum, jotdown ideas for his essay, think about whats he's gonna have for lunch, and play a video game. How's that for multi tasking! @CAPS2, you will be healthier. Think about it, better reflexes, better hand-eye, better and happier doctor! I mean seriously, if you play computer games you can have fun while knowing your going to make your doctor happy. And who do sent want to move your doctor happy! For @CAPS4 conclusion, computers have a positive effecton you because they help your education, talk to your friends and family, and have better hand-eye corrdination. Tell me right now that computer don't help people. I know, you can't because computers help us in so many ways.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that computer have bad effects on people. The first reason why I think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy kids and adults should stay @CAPS3 more. Kids and parents should only be aloud @NUM1 @CAPS4 on the computer then go outside. Computers are not so bad because @CAPS5 is helpful for looking up information but @CAPS5 is harmful @CAPS5 u abuse @CAPS5 kids play games on the computers and @CAPS5 damages there eyes and @CAPS5 makes them lazy. Also going outside there are lots of things to do instead of talking with your friend on the computer you should call your friend ask him to come over play games outside. @CAPS6 this continues lots of kids will be fit and @CAPS3. The second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people. Do not ever put something put something bad up on the computer because sometimes they are deep secrets and million of people will see @CAPS5 and that person might be teased and laughed at. And really the computer could do horrible things @CAPS6 you and this person are freinds @CAPS5 could break you guys forever. The final reason why the computer is not good is because people are dieing from overweight there is several teams that are on comercials saying that kids and adults @CAPS7 up and be @CAPS3 @CAPS6 @CAPS5 wernt for theese heros much much more kids would die faster, when kids die they look at whats in side of them and scientest found big fat chunks around the kids heart. Well thats my theory I hope all of you listen to my advice @CAPS7 up shut the computer of and @CAPS7 @CAPS3.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 would you like to be warmly greted by the zingbobway tabe @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, say hi to a far away family memorr again or maybe quicker your relfexes? Well you can! Computers are a use ful way @ORGANIZATION1 complexing an @ORGANIZATION1 these tasks. Imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. Wouldn't you want to see them at least once? Computers allow you to interact with them with webcams. You can see them and talk with them. Not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand eye coordination, and they quicken your raflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1,. says "@CAPS2 have shown that people who type or use a computer have better reflexes than those who don't." @CAPS3 a computer around is easier for school also I remember one time, I had to write a @NUM1 page paper for @CAPS4 and it was due the next day. I wrote the beginning @ORGANIZATION1 it and my hand started to cramp up. I had in finnish my paper soon so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also got a good hand-eye coordination . Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @NUM2 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM3 computers are used for learning about place and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity at your choosing! With a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days @ORGANIZATION1 your life. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers you can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the. Computers hold the world at your finger lips. So as you can see computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to interact with cites, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips. So stop reading and use a computer!

Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer company's such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now-a -days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous. Computer also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then do they exercise. Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus with encouregement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them graet self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be thw most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one.
<START>

Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause. 
<START>

Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you know that @PERCENT1 of people out of @NUM1 surveyed by the university out @LOCATION1 agreed that using lap tops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I agree that computers benefit society and every day lifes. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the world, they can help with school work, and make every day life eaiser. Five years ago I had to move from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our family and friends behind. However, with this great tecnology, we could e-mail them. Instant message them, and video chat with them, instead on having to face out money to make long distance calls. Theres many people out their like me. Who have friends and family far away, weather its family in different countries, old school mates and camp friends using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another. Using a computer can also more life easier. Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully that man and go online, pick the food that she and the quantity and she can get someone to deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping. So with her computer she can go to her favorite stores website and pick the clothes she wants. And then when @CAPS4 comes, a computer can be great not to worry about not having enough time to go and. A computers just have life that much simpiler!. Statistics how or people help online instant or going in. "Computers are great, I can homework and know that if they to write planner than they we to and out. If, they can and more of information on the computer from @CAPS5.com, then they could find in their local library. You can find almost anything with search engins on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers, or some also believe that some people abuse the benefit of computers and spend to much time on it and not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, not as long as you stay reasonable with usage or your computer, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, its great for keeping connections between people, simpling everyday life, and research for school.

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news. In conclusion computers are very useful and help us increase our knowlage, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. But most importantly computers are fun!

Dear Newspaper, I believe that advances in technology have many positive effects, such as computers. Computers are great for people of all ages. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to learn information from all over the world. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate through internet. Advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe. Advances in technology are amazing. Computers show these advances greatly. With the simple use of a computer, one can learn great hand-eye coordination skills. Typing skills are a great example. Typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the world. Without computers, no one would have these skills. A young child can go on the computer, play a game, and learn basic typing and hand-eye coordination skills to jump start their coordination skills for the rest of their life. Advances in technology are great. These advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information. Many times in school, students are asked to do a report on a different country. It would be very hard to do that report without a computer. The student would need to go through all different books to find specific information needed. With the internet, that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know. How about that family vacation you've always wanted to go on? Need an idea of where to go? Use the internet! All you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter. Instantly, you will have hundreds of choices right in front of you. This makes life a lot simpler. Do you remember the last time your mom or dad went on a business trip and you couldn't talk to the because they were busy? there is a fix to this with internet. You can communicate with them through @CAPS1, @CAPS2 or both. Just hookup your @CAPS2 to the computer and instantly say good @TIME1, or hows it going. If you have a friend that you can instant message them. It is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them on a matter of seconds. In conclusion, computers and advances in technology are great and can benefit everyone in the world computers tech hand-eye coordination, allow one to learn information from around the world, and allow communication through internet happen instantly. Writers and editors of the newspaper, please agree with me on this topic. Advances in technology can only add posotive effects to the way of life. Support advances in today's technology to help improve life for those of.

Dear @LOCATION1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very usefull piece of machinery. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When your in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. @NUM1 years ago I look a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! @CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that @MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computer is a good thing.
<START>

Dear, Local Newspaper writer I believe that computers benefit our society because we could connect to people more faster and easier. And computers @CAPS1 good for our society because of we don't have to spend to much time on the phone. That @CAPS1 why I think computers benefits our society. "@CAPS1 computers a good thing or bad thing?" Computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long. That @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer. That @CAPS1 without computers it will be different. I think people are not spending to much time on the computer", because a lot of people on the computer to do office work. Computer make things a lot easier for us! But sometimes people take advantage over it. That @CAPS1 why I feel people are not spending too much time on the computer. Last but not least that @CAPS1 why I know computers benefit's our society.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world.
<START>

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around.
<START>

Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have.

I walked into my living room. I saw my mom avidly reading the screen of our computer with pictures of caller masters and logos clastering the web page as well. I thought that the internet had just my mom better than I could that we should go on vacation. More and more people log on to a computer everyday, and although the people willing to change and believe in new advances in technology out on a strong argument of why computers are and there are still some that can only see the negative. I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential. Computers make the work even smaler. They allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant. Also, you can reconnect with friends that you can't see anymore. For example, I used to go to an awesome @DATE1 camp and I made same of my best friends there. But @DATE1, they down, and instead of playing sports and having fun, I layed down on my basement to stand up because my sweat glued to the. Then one day, I heard the familiar that my computer's spokes when I receive an instant @CAPS1, I the energy to crawl over to the screen, to find out @PERSON1, one of my closest friends from wanted to take a bike ride down to the wall, and hang out with some other people we knew. to say I happily respond, "@CAPS2 I definetly want to go," by a long scores of points. been for computers and @ORGANIZATION1. Instant @CAPS3, @CAPS4 would all have drifted apart and never talked again. anadem exaggerated argument people use against computer is that everybody that uses them doesn't exercise. I frequent my computer almost every hour, so I made a system to ensure I got exercise. Every time I walk the room my computer is hooked, I grab the pull up right and do @NUM1. I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago and I have already my own muscles, and I can do @NUM3 pull as at a time but when I started I struggled to do @NUM2. If not for the amazing of computers that me back, I would still do exercise, only to after about a week. Computers give easy to the internet, which has so much information it is. Unless it is a closely grounded secret. You could probably find whatever you want on the internet. Ive gone countless time to find for an essay with the limited textbooks have just isnt what you need. My country project @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pleces of information from a book! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well. As a matter of fact, my language arts teacher told us a story about how ever the @DATE1 a ball that has never done any sort of water sports before, spent @NUM2 weeks watching videos on youtube about how to waterski, and on his first dearly doing tricks. These are only a few of the reasons I think computers are great. They keep friend ships close, give you a reason to exercise, and can teach you anything! I say we spread the good word about computers and let every one know how awesome they are.
<START>

Dear computer co., computers have a negative effect. Why would you go outside if you could play life - like games on your @CAPS1? I lthink that the games on th @CAPS1 should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life. If people weren't on @CAPS1's all day, people would pay attention to the way they're destroying nature.
<START>

Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states "@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states "@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use @CAPS7 computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones." @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!

Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is bad. Some people spend way too much time on the internet. Many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep. This leaves them exausted for the day ahead. Alot of people spend too much time on the internet. Since they are always on the internet, they don't spend alot of time with their families. This causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends. Not exercizing is a result of this addiction also. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now. He doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help, most people won't do their choires, or make a meal for their family. These people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep. They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month my mom made a facebook. She is constantly on it. When she is on she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet. She also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on. You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercize or do thier chores. This is not a very good addiction to get into.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend way too much time on computers, some information on computers is inaccurate, there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use fir communication. A majority of peoples' time is spent on the computer. Whether its playing games, checking @CAPS2-mail, or even working, peoples' valuable time is getting used up. This time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family, being outside with nature or exercising. Being on the computer insteads of exercising has had a huge effect on people. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after. My sister works on the all day and she says @NUM1 or @NUM2 ladies at her work are un healthy because all they do is go on the the computer and eat granola bars, wich are usually healthy. If others spent at least a half an hour being outside to @CAPS3 some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, "@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day!" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching. Some of the information on the computer is very helpful, but you can never really know what information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet, how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand-eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life, will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicte with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people @CAPS2-mail, instant message, or even skype; a webcam website. What even happened to cellphones, you can take.

Dear reader, @CAPS1, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgable. Computers are only important for school, but also in the work place. They serve almost the same environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill.Some @MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone w/ other or not they want to spent their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one, everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for comuputers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house, they benefit everyone, everywhere.

Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with soemone easily is an unbeliveable privalige, that would be none existant without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in othe areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated expiriment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely acurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years therew ill be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positivly effected by computers. ALthough some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positivley in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Almost everyday, my mon and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. My dad always says " @CAPS2 makes the world go round." With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of @CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a @CAPS4. This will let you see the person's face are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his present wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symtom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will inhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastyly, computers (and tehn keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many, people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessability, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned.

Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block.

Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people today are depating whether having a computer benefits society. Computer benefit society in @CAPS1 way like it could help the childer with thrie school work. Not @CAPS1 childern are very out going but if they had a computer thatn that will really help them. Not @CAPS1 kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live. I'm pretty sure they don't care right now but the computer will help them out. As you can see the computer can help society. Every childern who goes to school has homework since kindergarten to when they end school. The computer can help them with their math homeworks, thier science, and even their sosial studies homework. When your kids get older starting middle school they have to do reports & pajects that recuar knolige tobe able to write or do the paper. If your a and can't take your childern to the libarey to take out @CAPS1 books that could get lost and you would have to pay for something that has been but and is not ablt o use again. But the computer all of that to society. The compter can help the comuncation in so @CAPS1 ways. @CAPS1 kids like to go on @CAPS2 to chat and parents think that @CAPS2 is their world, but it could happen that they are aranging a group to for. Now a days their are a lot more shier people who are scared to @ORGANIZATION1 people and be friend. but now their could be a lot more depress. The computer could also help you because you could be late or unable to go to an apointment or to a meeting & you lot the person in. This is a great way why computers help societey. In sociatey their are not a lot of people who now right away what they want to be when they grow up. If they us the computer and are really good at fixing them when the're broken that the ran be as computer @CAPS3 are so @CAPS1 beautful places that people take pictures of and up loud them into their computer. Some people don't see their talent until someone points it out to them. @CAPS1 people could be have a bad day and write a story out of it and send it to some of their friends, @CAPS4 their friend can send itto a publushers and make this person @CAPS5. As you can see their are so @CAPS1 great ways you can use the computer to help your sociatey. Readers the computer can help you in your school work. The computer can help the socitey communicat. It could also help people find their @CAPS6. I think that the computer does a great @CAPS6 helping the sociatey.

Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers. I strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time excercising and doing great opportunities for your self. Clearly, i think that lettng students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This very bad because when your addicted to something, you can go back. This means you will have time for anything. For example, they micht forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over , so don;t live your life in a box and play on nonsens live your life to the fullest. Over all, addiction in everything, including computers and a horrible . Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you excersise, the less active you are. This problem is specially for teens. Teens have computer every week. cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and the become node and neisty to their parents because they are testing to. As people dont excercise and move around alot, cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you eating food, but it can also ahppen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will an effect . Overall computers cause people to do the excercise and less active which will cause . Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are . In everyday life , teens on their cell phones , their computers listening to , music . these electronics are causing. If this goes on alot of teens will loose the people they. Computers are a waste of time because they can make you. because they have affect on people who use computers and other electronics.

Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, & I think that computers are very usefull and that people learn a lot from them. The computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented. Computers help when you need to know something about a certian person. @CAPS3 example is it helps students with homework. Last reason of why I think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends. First example of why I think computers are usefull is they help you if you need facts about a person. One example is you want to go to your a policeman and your leader tells you to meet him at @ORGANIZATION1, so you go there and he tells you the person they are going after but you dont know anything about him and you need a computer to see what he is convicted for and see his criminal record. @CAPS3 example is if your teacher wants you to do a report about" @PERSON3 lopez," but you don't know anything about him so you would use the computer and read about his life. Last example is if you want to learn about your countries history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer. Second example is students and their homework. One example is when your teacher says "I want a essay on @PERSON2 and I want it to be neat." But you have very handwriting and you cant do it on paper you will have to use word or a writing program on @CAPS3 computer. @CAPS3 example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is. Last example is if your teacher says find the book about the @CAPS1 and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow. So you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book. Last reason of why I think computers are helpfull in this society is because they help you get a hold of your friends & family. One example is if it takes to long to write letters to each other so you run use online messengers for example like "@CAPS2" or even "facebook and myspace." @CAPS3 example is if you don't send the letter to the write addrees so what you do is go online and ask a friend or family member. Last example is if want to see the person and talk to them so you can go webcam with them and even talk. I hope you agree with my opinion and think computers are usefull an also good for people. It helps people to learn about others and information about them. Second it helps students with school and homework, and lastly because they help you get a hold of family and friends. Therefore, I hope you like my letter and enjoy my opinion.

Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by its online, internet, and overall help in other things. My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is that computers have online. By online in chat rooms, bank, etc. this helps because people talking to other people online can beast there their morale. it can boest morale in situations like with military officers, soldiers because they don't get to see their family but online can change that in on instant. Online also helps because you can pay bills to gave bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank & a waste of gas. So, online is my for why you, the local newspaper, should agree with me. My second reason is that the internat benifits a lot. The internet, a marvelous created @NUM1 years ago . Its great because you can buy things it, like on a websites such as ebay, amazon, etc. This helps because it also saves time. The internet is great also because with the internet, you can learn of foreign nations. Finally, the internet helps because you can receive news through it. This benefits society because people can instantly hear about natural disasters & problems occuring in the community, rather than hoping to find it in the new or on television. Thats my second reason for why you should agree that computer do help. My final reason for why computers benefit what the help, overall in other situations used later rather thab just the computer. For example one way the computer can help in the future, is that a student can research info a bout a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project. Stedy has proven that computer training in the , by playing online games with other people, like in call of duty, helps boost soldiers' accorucy. it helps because it boosts their hand-eye coorination & we all increases their accuracy in target shooting @PERCENT1. This @MONTH1 not seem like much but, on the battle field, it can make the difference between life on death. Computers not only help that but they are plentiful & can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe. That my final reason for why you should go with computers. Some people might believe that computers are bad thing sina they take time away from exercise, but that can easily be solved by using the internet to buy an indoor joggee. Computers benefit society by using online. the internet, and overall help in future situations. There are the reasons for why I believe you should go for the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.

Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because, it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers.

Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't I think @CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'@CAPS1 only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @CAPS2's just a better source of information. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are alot of jobs that require computers. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. That is why computers are needed. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. That would be a terrible thing. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. You can learn about faraway places. You can have a job in the computer business. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, I think computers are a positive thing.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you look on a map of your effect all you see is computers everywhere. A map of the town compouters everywhere the state, the country, and even the world all you see are computers everywhere. @CAPS8 need to shut down these computers so @CAPS8 can start excersising, enjoying nature, and interacting with our families. It's times to finally help the world soldiers. Men, @CAPS4 you look around what do you see. Nothing but obesity. These so called computers are causing this why, look over there. There's @CAPS5. He used to weigh over @NUM1 pounds. All he did was use that blasted electrical error @CAPS8 call a computer. One day he realized he could do this no longer, and got same exercise. After only a year @CAPS5 just wayed @NUM2 pounds. You see, a man named @PERSON1, who's a doctor, computer expert, and wrote their books on exercise, nature and family, says, " @CAPS7 people would shut off their computers and use the gym, over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1's obesity would drop. "@CAPS8 must stop the madness men. Soldiers, do you know what's really a share about the enemy @CAPS8're fighting? It's causing people to miss out on this beautiful nature. You know @PERSON1 says that over @PERCENT2 of people will never go in nature @CAPS7 they get a computer. They don't know what their missing out on. I can picture it now the freshly plump hanging from the full bush of soring green. The mosuelous waterfall that shines @CAPS4 it off into a creek.The full dark scenary majestic. Lets not forget the lalaby of the crickets and owls putting you in a deep slumber under the staggering oak trees. This, soldiers, is what @CAPS8 need to get people hooked on not time consuming electronics. Men, do you want to know the solders part of this war? The hostages of the computer can't even sped time with their families. They're so busy on @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and other death comps that the real things important our alone. My friend @PERSON2 was one of the captives of the computer. He escaped just in time to stop one of his kids from going to an illegal party. Ever sence then, @PERSON2 has put his family before anything. Other families arn't us lucky though. In fact have @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT3 of families with copmuters have no communication and end up splitting up. The computers have gone to far now. Not only did they mess up people's lives, but their family too. This was must end now. Do you see our future now? It's filled with the computers on top. @CAPS8're their slaves @CAPS4 @CAPS8 come at their call. They won't let us excersise to shape, see the beatiful lands of nature,or spend time with our families so @CAPS8 can keep it together. This is why @CAPS8're fighting this is why were here will you join us?
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is all about Computers. They can do anything. But think are they really helping us? Yes, they do research and all of that but physically they're not. You spend less time exercising, interacting with family and friend, and the impact that computers can do to @CAPS1 lives in the future. Exercise is necessary in @CAPS1 lives. "People need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen". says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health. However, two in three @CAPS4 wont do so. Thats why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on is the way we are @CAPS3 I lazy, unactive worthless and overweight. As a result, computers are the blame. Are there some relatives you been face to face with @CAPS5 its because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us things like video chat with relatives for or go on facebook and myspace or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or email. The problem with this is being lazy. You could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them. but why waste enemy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent @PERSON2. @NUM1 in @NUM2 people havent seen there relatives for other states in years. People need to go computers @CAPS7 games, @CAPS8 hows all on the computer at the You dont even have to take This is bad, People need do @CAPS11 the old fashoned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple, theres no need to hire secretary, as employ and more office personals. Factories, They dont need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. Thats not good. In conclusion, Computers @MONTH1 seemed like the best thing that hit earth, but if you really, really think about @CAPS11, @CAPS11's not. @CAPS11 prevents you from exercising, seeing friends and family, and cam impact @CAPS1 lives in a bad way. I hope you see where I'm coming from.

Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. "I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well." @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying ",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By "bad people" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. "@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well once I stayed at @CAPS1 friends house and she was up on the computer all night she didnt even get any sleep. In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher "@PERSON1" says that "@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy. I mean theres a whole lot of side effects." @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that "@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that "I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often." @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement "Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people." @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family.

Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and "I.M.'s", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like "world of warcraft", "@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1", or classics like "@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can "I.M." your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?

Dear local newspaper, This world is filled with electronics. These days the computer is the latest hit. But even though it's popular, is it really the best item to have? Many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer. It is taking away their life. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. That's not how you should spend your life. We all want our children to be active and healthy, not be a couch potato. Each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. Now, every time a parent needs to punish or "ground" their child, they take away the electronics. What ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? Another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones. Kids are more worried about "@CAPS1" or "@CAPS2" or even trying to slay a dragon than spending time with their family. They would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. This computer is splittling families apart. Now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. Also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites like "@CAPS3" or "@CAPS4.com". More people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. Not many like going out and enjoying nature. Some don't like reading anymore because they rather play games. Some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. Also people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! The world is revolving around electronics. We need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the comuter for everything. Do we really wan't to destroy this world and lose bonding with our families? I say, make life better and get rid of computers!

I think computers are good because if you need to remember stuff all you have to do is just look at there emeil and they will remember what thay have to do and also it is good if you is lost all you have to do is look at the map quickly. if you need to finish a school project you could do it in the computer looking for the websit of the project, if you need to cheek a websit about enythiny inportent you could just tipe the websit down and it will show up on the computer and if your child don't have nothing to do they could play games in cluding math games, @CAPS1 games, and also thay could look for nock nock jocks.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I @CAPS5 when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and @CAPS6 werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since @DATE1 to @PERCENT1 of all americans use computers more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past @NUM2 years the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT3 and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I @CAPS5 most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says @PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! I hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life.. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of @CAPS1.

Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a pole conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter. Along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there. it will be stolen in the mail and @ORGANIZATION1 course the time that it would take to ge there. All @CAPS3 are solved in todays email and instant messiging (@CAPS2), @CAPS3 are relible, cant be stolen, and can go across the globe in seconds. Computers are not only a way for communication but also one @ORGANIZATION1 the most prominate ways to research, @CAPS4 the internet people would need to go to the library and run the risk @ORGANIZATION1 the book not being there or the library being closed. Through the internet all the information @ORGANIZATION1 the world is available @NUM1./ Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create @ORGANIZATION3 better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation @ORGANIZATION1 even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extreme benifit to socity and nessisary in this @ORGANIZATION3 era.

Dear Newspaper editor, I think that computers are @CAPS1 for everyone. First of all, you can learn about places that are around the world in a click. Also, you can communicate with friends and family. Finally, it makes your life so much easier. Here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. First, you can learn about things you didn't even know were real, in an instant. You can learn about ancient civilizations, different cultures, and different recipes for tonights dinner. you can get help in school work also. If you need to learn about the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION1, all you have to do is type in it. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in the matter of seconds. The internet is @CAPS1 for searching up all types of things. Secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. Ive heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. So on the computer you can talk to someone in @LOCATION2, and evrywhere else. Its like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it. You can do almost evrything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. Instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipies for chicken. Your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a @CAPS1 chicken for dinner. You can tell a friend that you cant it to there party. Also, teaches you homework that you did. if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do you will learn so many things. Its like having a book with everything you will every need or want to know. This is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time.

Dear, @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make @LOCATION1 friends. I will write @NUM1 paragrahs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play servays. Or you can find out facts. That how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people. You can meet @LOCATION1 people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend. Or there is social networking such as myspace, facebooks, twitter etc which you can meet @LOCATION1 people. Mostly everyone would like to meet @LOCATION1 people. To end this story my @NUM2 reason was yo can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people.

I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they’ve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're adicted to facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to you health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics? Dr. @LOCATION1 is as saying "People don't cause obesity, computers do" @CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on twitter, facebook, google and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking. I let you never of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when youre addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that youre not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives.

Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of find entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, @CAPS1-mail video chat, chat rooms, @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites), are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convienency issues. Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to aquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his moms, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as: flight times, prices, restaraunts, stocks, weather, news, and basically any fact that you need to know. All at these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebodys life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are for king for a late fee on a libary book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative.

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers @MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn much of what they know from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they @MONTH1 learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the bounddries of "@NUM1." They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face i'ts needs. Coordination can be very hand for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand. To help improve this people need practice. They can get this practice from exercise catching ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination in that it forces the brain to direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process @MONTH1 be excrutiatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice at this coordination improves and the process speeds up @CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day an age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in @LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast its social networking sites such as @CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in @LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates @NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over @NUM3 @CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning, and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do people benefit from the use of computers. Some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, help people learn, and allow people to communicate with others. The use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. Alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. These skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that I play. Clearly, Computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. Computers can also help people learn in many ways. There is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be in school. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. I use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has helped one as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @CAPS4 of hand writting. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate everyday through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I-chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practic is I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2’t you think computers help society? I do I strongly belive computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. Its easyer for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, gives kids some good facts to help build knowlege and not only would it help kids but it will help adults too. Its easy to see why adults think kids dont read enough however kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. some parent think that just because kids arent going to the library to take a book out for their report they arent gaining knowlege but they are gaining knowlege because all of the things they could look up in a library they have availible to them on the computer. Computers help kids around the world find thing quickly and easily. Not only does the computer give them knowlege of things that happen in the past but also things happening in current times. It can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can finf on the computer. Some parents think that kids arent getting enough exencise but never the less they are also skiping out on a lot of knowlege and important facts also. On the computer you pick up a lot of facts such as wether updates natural desasters how to help others in need and other very important facts. If it was't for computers kids would not make up for all the knowlege they miss in school. on make up for what they miss when they are dosent. Computers help people everywhere gain knowlege. Not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults. They can do work over the computer look at houses, cars and lots of other important things. Certenly @CAPS1 you would not want to take away all of things knowlege and help being given to hot kids and adult on the computer. It helps aldults especialy keep thing going in there baissy lives. It also helps than make changes such as how they eat or act @CAPS4 are some reasons penale should not disaprove of computers because they help kids with @CAPS3, give kid important facts and, help people of all ages. sarely some of @CAPS4 facts could helpchange,

Computers definitely have a positive impact on society. They help organize your thoughts, which stress. So, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for surless. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. Computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. Imagine you working on a project in school. Everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. In addition, you @MONTH1 also block the programs that you don't want. This device is called the computer, and it's changed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 suffer from stress. Now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated. Instead of worrying thoughts you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society. Also, the computer contains articles that @MONTH1 insure our children to strive for their goals. Once child read an article @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 book. As an @NUM3 using @PERSON1 as well in school. By games, I observe how into @CAPS3 since I started seeing @PERSON1 as role model to me, high making a stride for a @CAPS4.O @CAPS5. Where did this inspiration come from? Researching @PERSON1 on the internet. The internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. Lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. If you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? Often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. If you take a break go on you @MONTH1 relax simple games put out a variety of websites. Now say you came back and attack the problem again. You continually chip away at it, and it seems overwhelming. Thank you computer gods! The computer, in this instance, has made - positive impact an @CAPS6 society. So as you can tell, computers make a strong, positive impact on @CAPS6 society.

Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion I think people are spending to much time on technology because their is many people I know who stay on technology and don't even do work. Also, spending to much time on the computers and others things then taking time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells. Some times people get locked because to much information was given out or you did somthing that you were'nt suppose to do. Downloading certain things also bring harm to your computer like viruses that can crash downthe computer hard drive and system. There are many good and bad thing about being on a computer like the bad things stalkers, hackers, seizers, blindness. Then the good thing about being on a computer is it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, even allow people to talk online with other like friends or family. In my life it helps a little because I play lots of army games so when I go out with my cousins and friends we go label tagging in a sports complex and I use the same tactics that i learn to beat the other teams. It hurts some people eye site when all their doing is stairring durectly at eh screen. one experience was like @NUM1 months ago the last time I stayed at my aunts house all my cousins do was stay on th ga me till they have to take a bath, clean and eat, They didn't even go to sleep till eight in the @TIME1. Some parents should at least give an hour a day to say he game. For me I only go on the computer for like twenty minutes then log and go back online later on in the day.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to @CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, @CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3 a @CAPS6 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, @CAPS6 @CAPS3 <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while @CAPS6 A <@PERCENT1@NUM4> passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. Without computers I dont know what I would do. Scientist tool surveys that @PERCENT1 to the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even contents, hey have to have some way to be in contact. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up giving unwadged citizens a sorce of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relay on computers. Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. Computers are a terrific way for human to adap to the fast life.

Dear local news paper I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, @CAPS1 it helps you find information on something you didn't know. @NUM1 precent of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book. Most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment he/she is giving the student the ability to explore out side of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, @CAPS2 better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. @CAPS1 if you just heard on the news about a tradjic accident like the eartquake over in @LOCATION1, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. Im sure almost every person has read a book and came accross a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well you can use the computer to look up the words.The computer will give you the full deffinition and how to pronance the word. Computers @CAPS1 will help you find any information you @MONTH1 need, "AND @CAPS3!" In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, "And @CAPS3!"

Dear @CAPS1, I feel as though computers have good effects on people. Throughout these next paragraphs I will be giving you all of my reasons on the things that computers help people do. I will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills, how they give information to people, and how they allow us to socialize. Over ninety four percent of people today own a computer ad feel as though they have learned many things from it. I bet you didn't know that! First off I will be telling you about how computers help people type. The @CAPS2 on a computer doesn't go alphabetically. This means that you have to practice more to get better in typing. I remember the first time I tried to use the @CAPS2 it difficult but as I tried more I got better. Once I got better I realize where the keys were and soon I don't even have to look up the computer and all of it's parts help people by teaching them skills that they @MONTH1 used in the. These skills @MONTH1 be needed in their job field. Computers are helpful device. The next thing I will be telling you about is how computers have information that is useful to and its where a child is working know a lot about the. It holds information and has website when the internet they. The computer. My final reason why computers have good effect. If you need to talk to a friend but dont feel like calling them you can just go on to a website and chat with them. There are so many that you just can't choose! Did you know what they are over one million of these kinds of websites? There is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 just to name a few. This also gives people the chance to socialize with people from all over the world. This in return causes people to have better social skills. Maybe they will become ore friendly and become more outgoing. This is all because of one little thing and that little things is the computer! So as you can see computers have many wonderful effects on people. They help people get better at typing give lots of information that people want to know and get better social skill cant you just learning and I dont know about not I can get a pretty clear image of that in my mind. Thanks for reading this and taking I say information.
<START>

I think computer have shaped @LOCATION1 to what it is today. Computer help people learn, give people a passtime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and its eaiser to make changes. Also, its cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there. Another example, is that a computer teachees you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people passtimes. One example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through facebook or aim. Another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype. Finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside don't know that their are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. Another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @CAPS1. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time. Now reading this I hope you believe that computers benefit society.

Dear @CAPS1, In many ways computers are helpful but, I don't support the use of them. The advance in technology has really taken away from peoples lives all over the world, some examples of this are lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time spent with family and friends. Continue reading for more on as towny computers do'nt benefit society. As you know, when you use a computer you usually sit in a chair to do so, correct? Well, this activity is doing only one thing, not keeping you healthy or inshape. I'm sure that you want to be healthy, and to be healthy you must get some sort of exercise through out your day, and sitting on thje computer is not helping you one bit. So as you can clearly see, so far using computers is not beneficial to our society, continue for more cons of using computers as much as they are used. Believe it or not, using a computers is unhealthy, and not beneficial, in more than one way. The reason for this is because, not only oo you not get enough exercise, you won't go outside as much. you @MONTH1 be wondering as to why not outside is unhealthy, but it is because you dont recieve the needed amount of fresh air that you need to not be sick. Could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority at their day? Well, lets just it wouldn't be fun to count them all. Now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society.Keep reading for one rest way. As you probably knows, it is a hard task to keep a big family close to each other, and using computers is'nt going to anything to help you. So, why use them? Trust me, spending quality time with your family and friends can be just as much, or even more fun than playing your favorite computer games, and in my opinion your family should be the most valuable thing in your life, so don't lose them for a computer. Now that you have finished reading. i would like to thank you for your time reading this letter concerning, lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time with family, is not beneficial to society.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are. You can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you can't say that I am just a kid and she plays on it all the time. Well that is true however, it can teach you hand-eye coordination. For @CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster. Another @CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type. Me personally am faster at than writing. My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music and relax. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let's say writing a story for school. You just started the story and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do well if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast. That way you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn haw to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine like to write more than type that is ok. We will not be not friends after that we will just like the same thing that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want. As well as do other things as well as the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Over all computers have a positive effect on people.

What I think about computers benifiting our community is great. Tecenology has gone far over the years. The most important is the computer. Most schools have computers. The reason is that benefits society. They are a hudge save in paper. You also learn more thing about place @CAPS1 any thing. These reasons support why we need to have computers. Computers benifits our community by saving paper. It also make our work neater. We can talk to friends and familys. The main reason is that it give computer technians more jobs people need more jobs computer also provide news. say The mayor need to send and iportant message about polluting the water he can do that through email. The main thing today in our society is going green. The only way we can do that is by swiching to computers. We have to chop so many trees down just to get @NUM1 paper to each kid in the grade. Aduts should understand we need to conserve paper. Now I know what your thinking what of we need to print something. My response is that you just could email it to a teach friend or any body else. Kids these day need to learn more about other cultures. We need to know what there econimy. The fastes what we could do that is internet. It is so much faster than looking through thousands of books. All you have to do is type the place you want and boom there it is. There are many benefits to having a computer my final reason is it also give you great hand I cordination. And if you want to be a athe lite than you need lots of it. How the computer gives you hand I coordination is from typeing an moving the mouse. The best way is to play lots of education video games. Whith all the facts and statement I gave you like benifiting community, going green and also learn about other place. Please when you are writing you article before and listen to my facts.

Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that "@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing." @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, "@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website." @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, "families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at.

Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers is dagerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. The hinder us from excersising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Excercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain as a fit and health human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day. Too much computer time even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before scientists have concluded asked, that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the body was built to work. If you have seen wave, one of @ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, undertaking is easy. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an of course, but minor visions of this are going around the world. Going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it. If you wanted to see a frog or of some other animal, can't just @ORGANIZATION2 it, look for it in the real. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and ill. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it until it's or you're too old. Learn how to do somthing by. Instead of hiring someone to make at, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a lift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then your not supporting your family, you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this!:You have nothing except your laptop. You're a , on and have family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers. To sum it all up, computers maybe, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside!
<START>

Imagine a world without computers chaos in war, even the cluter on your desk. The chat you're having with you bestfriend on aim wouldn't happening. The report on @LOCATION1 might not get done because all the books were checked out, in fact we wouldn't have noble or any space program without computers. I know of this happened I wouldn't be happy. Compaines almost relys on technology you can't just send a letter and have @CAPS2 at the office in five minutes. Communication through the computer is very popular. @PERCENT1 of the world use aim or another chat service, in a studie done by a @CAPS1 professor @NUM1 out of every student doesn't talk to family on aim service a quote from the professor said "@CAPS2 a good thing to stay in touch with their familys as wel as keeping up to date on curent events. @CAPS5 computers are taken away information is gone. Its all lost in some pile of papers. @DATE1 time my computers crashed and I had a report due but all the books were gone. That report was done @DATE1 when they were fixed. Now thanks to the new computer @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 more organized a nasa is running on mars. Nasa runs completely by computers. Look what they have given us today. @PERCENT3 of all household aplienses come from nasas work. A coment from nasa imply @PERSON1 "@CAPS4 would be no cars or phones without use, their coumputes to." @CAPS5 thats true are they going to take away cars and phones as well. We need you the people to dicide. The people who made this country what @CAPS2 is to dicide do think we shouldn't have coumpters. I don't and neather should you.

Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of affects on people. Some affects are it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life and you don't get enough excersise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1; and I asked," @CAPS1 you go over your grandmas house what do you usually do?" @CAPS2 said, "I usually use the computer." @CAPS3 do you want to use the computer while your their? your with your family your supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games bring them! People think that because there is facebook, aim, e-mail, and myspace that your interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said "They are great interacting websites." They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 your sititng in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While your sitting in the chair your not excercising, @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5 your gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 your stuffing your face wih cheez- itz and not excersising I asked @PERSON2 a question it was what do you do while your on the computer? @CAPS2 said "I eat.." @CAPS5 isn't bad, but @CAPS1 your not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leaguges of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get @CAPS7! Computers aren't the greastest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up, and be mature for the future.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scients say that if you actully play a sport you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 then if you didnt. Before there computers life was simpole, no student forgot there homework. But now they use there computer many things can go wrong. First the printer can break. @CAPS1 year my printer stoped working @NUM1 times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affectde my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convienet is you are capable of doing writing during school @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1 i had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got down stairs she told me I had to write it so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers. In my house all @NUM7 people in my family has a computer but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extreamly expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2 you could buy many books and magisnes insted of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so the gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convienent then writing by hand. Finally they are a major waste of money. The decads without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happpier.

Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 if I was with or aganist people using computers. But I thought about it I decided that i was aganist using computers. For the same reasons, safety stop education, sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people @MONTH1 think how come using a computer is not safe. Well eventhough you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer what you do over computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be thats thirty and we be like @NUM1, @DATE1 and I use those ages because kids are age be the man one on @CAPS2 myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like @NUM1 - @DATE1 and us not knowing he comes on myspace or @CAPS2 put another picture up there of young did we start thinking to him meet up and something had happend. For example my friend who was on myspace was talking to a fourty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his age and she was rapped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Bieng on the computer is not going to bring are education up is going to brings down. The reason why this is most @DATE1 threw @NUM3 come home from school put there hookbag down eat and then do straight on myspace, @CAPS2, @CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, doing their homework. Eventhough those websites do help you learn but only about for myspace, read messages on @CAPS2 look at people comments on @CAPS5. Like for example I would go and instead of me learning new I am bieng and learning new information. Learning brings achievement, a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites thats not appropriate all I can say is watch what you on and see on myspace cause you might just but into something you not suppose to such as raped that went on. Be careful.

Dear @CAPS1, "@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem "too good to be true." @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, "@CAPS5, just one more game!" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. Computers are advanced our world little by little every day. We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like @ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you @MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment. Finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. Certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. Wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning.

Dear, local Newspaper @CAPS1 I read the article and I think that you guys are right because in the @DATE1 kids rather stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1 who know's what they do @CAPS1 some kids are on facebook all day some are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer. If were always on the computer we wont learn nothing at school because when were at school kids could be thinking about going home to go on the computer and you wont focused on our education @CAPS1. And what if kids drop out or dont come to school anymore because they to be chatting with their friends or a stranger. What if a girl didn't want to go to school and on her computer. What if she is talking to a stranger computers so kids can just go and do some exersis instead of being on the computer and wont be a beast anymore.

Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 a “home on your town; all you hear is, “mom, mom , mom drive me to the library to get books”. You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money. Is this what you want every home to start looking like? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places you’ve always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest. For these reasons computers are what benefits society most. First of all, computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1 @NUM2 a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, there’s no need to worry about paying phonebills. Also, @PERSON1 a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online. Furthermore, just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. What’s more is that they can be in the bedroom or room. A boy name @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web. Also, @PERSON3 a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @PERCENT2 of them they did. That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands. Last but not least, computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you and everything, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time comsuming because they haven’t used one yet. Also did you know that million people use a computer that’s more than half their population and such a poor country? That shows her important computers are and how convenient. All and all, now @CAPS1 have if happy residents, laughing on the computer they do because computers allow them to talk with friends learn and visit foreign countries and are so convenient @PERSON2 and readers computers withour a doubt benefit society.

Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.

Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It not only ables you to find out information, and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand eye coordination. A computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @LOCATION1 creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. New computers now have webcams. This benifits you to see and speak to them without having to get on a plane or any long car rides. Which I know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. Having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds. The society today wouldn't be the same without computers.

Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, "chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places." I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration.

Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about all the intresting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school. Today it seems like the world is held together by technology and I think computers are at number one. "@CAPS1 my older sister moved to @CAPS2 it was hard to keep intuch and see eachother, but we found out about @ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam eachother, so we do that everyday and it's like she never left home." @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 sure @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people get more done in the day online @PERSON1 says "everyday my day is shortened because my @CAPS3 because while at work I can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o clock @CAPS1 I arive home from work I can make doctor apt, school apts and schedul meetings all with one touch/click where ever I go, instead of looking on the calander or picking up the phone. @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via twitter, facebook, myspace or aol. The internet is great for meeting new people because you @CAPS4 eachother and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and things. You cand find peolple just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a sucessful friendship today. Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. Students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even tv you name it the web has it. Personaly I spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. After I might go walk or play my @CAPS5 but i'll still conected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on wi-fi connections. So I think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. I hope by now you feel the same

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or "easy way @CAPS6 " in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks " @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say "@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually.

Dear local @CAPS1 I hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and I have many reasons why but I will tell you is. First the games teach hand eye coordination, teach people about faraway places like other countrys, last it helps to keep in touch with people. My first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day. It does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer. This will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important. Also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places. If you are going on a trip I would want to know about that place to see what I need. Or to just look at how beuatiful the countrys are will make you amazed. So for just @NUM1 reasons I would already rethink. Finally I think this is most important reason of to stay in touch with I know my mom dont got a facebook and she talking to all he old friends she says "nice" I think have friends is very important to everyone and computers help them. I conclusion there are reasons why a computer is good like hand eye coordinations learning about faraway places. So I hope you have been I know I would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice.
<START>

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers are a waste of time and that they are dangerous. Yes computers can be dangerous but they can also help you in @CAPS1 diffrent ways. Such as paying bills on line or planin vacation and even attending collage classes. For @CAPS1 people bills are a strugle. They are an incovenienc and there are way to @CAPS1 of them. If you think about it @CAPS1 people work all day on some time all night, wouldn't it be nice to come home and have all your bills payed? Well one way you can do that is from a computers, computers have @CAPS1 programs that can help you pay your bills faster so that when you come home you can relax and enjy you free time. Computers are also good for planing vactions. @CAPS1 people each year use on line programs to plan there vacations and trips, for example my family and I planed a trip to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 of @NUM1. When we get to the airport we had first class tikets and a ride wateing when we got of the plain that @DATE1 was the best so far. Going into a new generation @CAPS1 people are starting to take on line colleg classes do to the fact that they work or have a kid at home these @CAPS2 are good for people with jobs because they are short and you learn alot. A computer is very helpful for taking these classes because if you did not have one it would incible you from taking the class. A computer is a great thing to have for all these things. So if your a mother of a worker and you would like to go back to school you should consider taking on line colleg classes. And if your family wants a vacation you should try out one of the @CAPS1 programs the enternet has for travling.

Dear, whom @MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I belive you are right. Computers can be helpful, let us chat with people but we don’t exercise. Forget about family and most importantly yor health their vision gets bad, they eat more junk foor and that can lead to bad cholersterol. High blood pressure and even diabities. A computer is very addicting people stay up on it for hours. It will give you bad higiens so I think you should really take a look at this and put this on the Newspaper and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents I know it could be very fun and ejoyable but it would be all fun and games until your very sick you @MONTH1 take this as but this is highly serious in many ways. Not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for. A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view so I think all computers should be banned for at least one week to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This @MONTH1 seem like were overacting on this but we really arent. Do you want population on people having diabetis and other causing affects that can happen to your body increase. Well I think not how would that make you feel. Not good al all so people get of your feet and jogg. Do whateverenjoy time with your family. So just listen to me and stop this badd habbit.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagine a world without computers? Well I @CAPS1't because I think computers are great. First of all if you have a computer you @CAPS1 meet new people. Second you @CAPS1 do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly in a computer you @CAPS1 basically find out anything you want to know. Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great. Who doesn't like meeting new people, because I do. If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you @CAPS1 look them up on your computer. Also if you had nobody to talk to one time you @CAPS1 go on the computer and try to meet new people. I know I do that all the time. Lastly it doesn't hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online. it's actually fun once you try it. So that's why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet. Second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer @CAPS1 help. My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how @CAPS1 I do that with out a computer. Also if one day you forgot your homwork or any assignments just ask a friend online of if you have a school website look on it. Therefore computers are great because all assignments look ,better when they are printed. My last reason is because on a computer you @CAPS1 pretty much look for anything. For example, say you wanted to find a place to go to and you didn't have a adress or anything, you @CAPS1 always check on the computer. Also if their is a problem or something with you house, car, bills, or anything you @CAPS1 always see if you @CAPS1 get any hekp on internet. Lastly if you wanted to buy anything and you could't find it any stare you @CAPS1 just get it online. So basically like I said you @CAPS1 do anything. In conclusion I think omputers have a great effect on life. First you @CAPS1 meet how people or friends. Second you @CAPS1 do projects or homework. Lastly you @CAPS1 basically do anything on a computer. So that's why I think computers are great and they @CAPS1 help alot in life instead of hurting anyone.

Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature. Let me explain, people and kids these days do have alot of exercising. People who don't exercising can gran weight if they don't exercising at all. Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game. Wouldn't you agree the kids and adults can hang out with there frienda and family. Kids need to stop going on the computer and go outside more offing with their friend or family. You might want to consider that parent need to spend time with there friend and family then staying on the computer at home. Don't you think that people should go outside and enjoying the nature. Amazingly, people know what nature is but the don't know what the true meaning of nature is! Adult should spend time by going outside then stayin at their house because @PERCENT1 of the world dont have computer at all.
<START>

To the computers people technology is a good thing to have. If we do not have technology then we can not call no one. We wiil not have computers to go online. We can not talk to my family or friends. People us technology for they jobs like people that work for cars they need computers to see if the cars if old. That is why will need technology. People need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us. Computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on. We call people with technology you us computers to go online on google.com that is why we need technology. so we can call people.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years computers has been a great invention. It helped people learn more information, communicate with people, and @CAPS6 invent more technology. This is a positive effect for our country. let me excplain. Computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go. The computer helps me find information for my science project faster than going to the library and looking up information on a book." @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in @NUM1 grade. In case we get lost on the roads the computer can @CAPS6 us get to out location. Another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us communicate with our friends and family."@CAPS3 I cant contact my mom I email her on my computer." @CAPS2 @PERSON2. Also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing. The last reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us invent diffrent things. Scientist can easily invent more kinds of technology by using the computers." The computer has helped us first make a model of our invention then we start making the details." @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS1 the years computers helped us with almost everything. Conclusion the computer @CAPS6 us with our search for information, @CAPS6 contact people, and @CAPS6 make new inventions. This has also helped us in wars. We should let the computers be in the @LOCATION1

Dear @CAPS1, I think that computer are a waste of time, but they also help you in many ways. You should only go on the computer if you really have too. Peple are on the computer for hours at a time, they go on the computer if they are bored or if they don't want to go outside. People have made the computer daster and more effective. So more and more people buy computers each year. Computers als helsp you in al of ways, you can learn from a computer, you can find a job on the compter, and you can also shop on the computer. So if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you. You can learn from the computer. The computer can give you so much information it is unbeleiveable, you can look up anything and even ask questions. Last, you can shop on the computer. Say you can find something in a store and you looked everywhere so you go home and you can go on the computer and find what you are looking for. But, you most likely are going to need a credit card. So this is why I think computer are helpful but a waste of time.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, I am on the computer alot. But I think it is one of the most addicting, time consuming inventions in todays society. Yes, computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you don't see that often, doing school work, and gathering information. But in my oponion I the people should reduce their usage of computers. Sure, computers let you interact with friends in family via e-mail, or @CAPS2 messaging, or social networking websites such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Guess what? You can easily communicate the old fashioned way with cell phones, or even writing a letter. See? There are alternitives for communication. Exercise is so important now a days, and people do not get enough of it. Did you know that obesity, has gone up @PERCENT1 since last year? Thats a fairly big percentage, and we don't want it to get any bigger. If people are wasting away, staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort or exercise in, the number will get bigger. Also, computers can cause all kinds of medical problems. For example, about a month ago my back was really bothering me. I went to the doctors and he told me one of the likley causes was leaning foward togo on my laptop. "Computers can also cause vision problems and haedaches." says specialist @CAPS5. Oz. We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers! We can limit our use to two or three times a week, and only use it for important reasons. I hope this really is an eye-opener to the negative effects computers have on us.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some can be terrible, and others not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on facebook and other interactive websites such as twitter and @CAPS1. This crisis is interfering with school, work, or excersize. More and more people each day are not getting enough exercize or work done. We have to stop this devastating pandemic! People who are staying inside all day arn't as healthy as they were before. There immune system making the risk of getting sick greater. This can cause people in severe positions or even death. @CAPS4 you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and make it more important. In order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike. @CAPS2 someone is inside on the computer frequently, they arn't @CAPS2 you're addicted to something like watching t.v. or playing @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you are addicted to the it can also interfere with family events, sports. @CAPS2 youre on the computer you forget about homework, grades drastically making you go to summer school, or even repeating a grade. Also @CAPS2 you don't prepare for sports it can make you not play up to your potential. This is why computers are affecting every day people. There are more reasons how people are being affected by computers, but these are the most common.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personaly disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it not the computers folt people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not excerising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life. The most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even through they had that terriable storm. I thank you for listening to my opinon and I hope that it change's your point of living a life without computers
<START>

Being active has no limit, but technology does.

Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question might be answered forever. I have an opinion about this and it might not effect everyone in the world but I do hope so. Exercising, great way to stay in shape but is you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day you don’t have a chance to stay in shape. So while everyone is fit you eventually will be fat. Whik you sit there playing the some @ORGANIZATION1 game everyon is out side playing at the park, swimming in the pool or fishing at the lake. Sitling on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life bot physically and socially. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending time with friends and family. Also this will stop you from interacting with new friend, and your old ones will find new ones. Lastly, I you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you were waiting for since you can remember. So the next time your friend says to go online after school, say you'd rather not because you don't want to get addicted.

Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to yourself. Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call.

They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing.

Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. it is a convienient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My firsty reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spend with family, but I talk to family, and friends everytime on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a conveinient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if their not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online, the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chating on the @ORGANIZATION1 you @MONTH1 have no idea who they are, it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more conveinient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach said and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type good, and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, amny young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss @MONTH1 like, and apreciate you more. Which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very nifly to have around! my third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1, and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted, and @MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. "@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about" says @PERSON1, at the @NUM3.) @CAPS1 there you have it, computers use is not a major problem. It is a conveinent communication device, an effective way to learn social, and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. @CAPS1 there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me.

I agree that computers do benefit society because every one uses one or has one it helps you with important stuff the computer makes things easy. Computers, give exercise in a way it makes your fingers move faster. The computer is the best thing ever that happend to this world you can chat with your friends family, print writing play games. What can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you wana just sit there never get off of it its addicting to people but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer. If the others had an computer they would change there mind. You can go on myspace thinks to tom talk to friend family people from a diffrent town, state. You also can go on google yahoo, facebook, twitter the computer and internet is really fun and it give you a little exercise. And it helps you with your school work, home work, research of a country, place, house, vacation you can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy strong and it will get playing sports more and having fun outside instead of staying in side all day doing nothing staring at your computer screen not wanting to get sleep or going out side so both pretty much the same to me but I do with the first opionion because computers are the best!

You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society.

Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrubt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interactment, and they waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't set aside time for such. Our planet is run by us humans and if we don't take care for its necessities, we will all die including our beloved planet @LOCATION1. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity but technology (computers) take a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club (adult once children!), help out neighbors ect. So what if they teach hand eye cordination they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future nobody would want the future leaders to be known for the widespread obesity. Never theless, computers take away "bonding" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact ith their "online friends". And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers if people didn't waste so much time on computers they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they "don't have enough time". When all their time is devoted to To computers if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have @CAPS1 of time to do such. No one wants a "stay at home" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs and eat the people's time away, you @MONTH1 think computers allow others to "chat" online with their "online friends" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs which results in a low self esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the "benefits of computers." people will soon stop believing that non sense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they?

Computers, Computers, Computers, its all we hear about today. New websites, chatrooms, games and much more. I agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers take over peoples lives, you don't know who is looking you up on facebook or @CAPS4 and know you can do almost anything on them. Lunch...,@CAPS1...,@CAPS2...,@CAPS3....Computers are taking over our lives. Believe it or not some people bring computers everywhere they go and once you get on that @CAPS3 chances are you won't be getting of it for a while because you keep clicking and keep finding new stuff. I do have to say computers are a cool device but there has to be a limit. We can not be on the @CAPS3 @NUM1 looking up what @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2... You got to come back to earth and spend time with your family. The @CAPS3 might be a cool device but that does not meen that it is safe to post stuff about you on. Facebook & @CAPS4, probably two of the most dangerous sites to be on. Anybody could just type in @PERSON1 and get @NUM2 maches and find you eventhough you don't know them. People are not always as they say they are. People could say taht they are a @NUM3 year old. Just leaving college when it's really a @NUM4 year old @CAPS6 just getting ready to enter the senior center. Don't trust anybody. Now and days you don't even have to leave your house. You can shop, talk, @CAPS5 taxes, bills, and have a vurtual life on the @CAPS3. Pretty soon @CAPS6 kind as a human will become all together through the @CAPS3. Some computers probally have a smarter system then same humans do. What I am saying is limit your time to the @CAPS3 or thats where you will be spending it all. Know you know that I think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day. Also that they are taking over our lives, are dargerous, and you don't even have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you take my thoughts into consideration. Thank you.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. Computers gives you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world; also computers gives you the opportunity to go on educating websites, and last makes it easier to shop and pay bills. Talking to people from around the world can be interesting. Computers help you do that, using the internet. You can learn almost different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one ime price. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites. On the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and won't have kids bugging you about what's their average in a certain class. Yes, I know their are bad unappropriate websites, but their are a lot of ways to block them. For an example I had a @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 and I needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called studyisland and by going on that everyday boosted my grade up to a @CAPS4. Computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. Their are ways that your things that you buy online could come a few days late; but think about how much time and money your saving because you ordered offline instead of going to the store. But it's also very helpful to people with disability. They're are a lot of positive things about computers. They give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and gives you a chance to go on educating websites, and last helps you pay bills and go shopping. Local Newspaper computers are a big benefit too society, and without them a lot of things would'nt be possible.

Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well. Yes, i, agree some people do spend too much time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't helped us. Computers help children and adults learn so much. Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not doing to well. A ton of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers. An that means @PERCENT1 of the people won't have jobs. Computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped catch law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can story already arrested criminal's finger prints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous record, etc. to help us catch criminals. So yes computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on thse machines, it's their decision and look how much computers have helped us. Make the right decision let out technology continue to edvance.

Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me " @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?" and i answer "@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3." @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much.

Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your "status" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the "call" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say "organization is the key to success", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?

About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature.

Dear newspaper, I think computers have a good effect on people. Computers are very helpful to many it gives them an education, and they can interact with many people. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Working with computers can give people extremly well hand-eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 said, "In recent surveys and tests, I have noticed a major increase with hand-eye coordination of @PERCENT1 all thanks to computers. "Computers is also a way that people can learn to type in a recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1-more students know to type, thanks to computers. Computers can be very helpful to business people with creating power points. Instead of making a really big poster board for @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project, I made a power point instead that was so much easier. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things. For example, students can learn about interesting places that they never knew about. "@CAPS2 friends is moving to @LOCATION1 and she has no idea what it's like, or where it is. So, we looked it up on the internet and found out so much cool stuff about it, " says @PERSON5 computers can also teach students about new cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of the students learned about @NUM2 new cultures in one year, thanks to computers. Not only can computers tell people about interesting places, but interesting people. I never knew that president @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers, and gre up in @LOCATION2, did you? Computers can be used in schools to help teach students about new things. Computers are used by many people to interact with another. using computers is an easy way to talk with friends. Using instant messenger is free! Now parents don't have to pay annoying phone bills anymore! In a recent survey done in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 of the people there thought that using computers to talk to friends was alot easier. Computers can help people meet new people online. Habe you ever heard of the dating sites? Well, this is what @PERSON1 has to say about it, "@CAPS6 wonderful! @CAPS2 husband and I met online and we have been together for @NUM4 years." @CAPS7 you have a faw away cousin and if you call or write them a letter it's too expensive? Well now you don's have to worry about that anymore because talking to distant relatives online is free! "@CAPS6 so much easier talking to people online." says @PERSON3. Computers can be used to interact with another. Computers have a very good effect on people. They are helpful, can be used to give education, and they can be used to interact with another.

To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said "false information" @CAPS2 she had gotten the information from a book. she pobably would've gotten an "A+". Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2 she was on, daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending to much time on the computer @CAPS2 you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming to addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice.

Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good, technology can affect adults and even more is children. Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades. I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down, I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @CAPS1 t a @CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading. I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go's from once a day to twice a day and further on its as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go. People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing, young females and males think its exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but its not exciting its very dangerous. Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we wouldn't know because on chat lines you dont have to put your fear name, you could put a false picture, and unknown age that's why in cases something go missing because they didd'ent think before they started chating. Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer. In conclusion @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers and its not a good thing you could miss a day out of work or you can be tired and exhaused because all your energy is wasted stay off of computers unless educational.

@ORGANIZATION2. Hey ma name is @PERSON1 I'm @NUM1 years old I go to @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 going to talk to you about expert people saying that computers are effecting the society. But technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. People think computer benefits society, @CAPS3 it don't people learn more they also could talk to people online if they dont got a cell phone to talk you could also research places you wana go to vacation and you could see how it look. Computer is one of the best things they inveted, but is bad to some people because they want to search direction and vecation places but they cant so is hard for people who dosen't got a computer to find out, computer dosen't benefit the society. Those who support advances in technology belive that computer have a positive effect on people. A computer is one important in ma life if @CAPS2 behind in some classes I could do some research and study at home and learn about it. I lost ma cell phone but now I talk to ma friends online when ma parents dosent wana take me shopping I go shopping online is easyer to look fourwut you want. People learn alot with computers, computer is @CAPS3 the world. You could see earth, space the city and wuts going on in internet computer dosent effect the society dosent effect the society in makes it easyer. Give people ability to learn about far away places and people and even allow people to talk online people. I dont know about @LOCATION1 the only thing I knew it was hot but I searched abot it @LOCATION1 is like a cool/park is alot of fun things you could do so I want for vacation and things was true. Online is a great place to chat with friends or family you could keep in touch. Some expert people concern that people are to mouch time in computer instead of exercising. @CAPS1 people do spend alot of time in computer but they do exercite when they go out with family the play the sport when they shopping the are walking thats exercising i bee in the computer @NUM2 but I still exercite I play basketball all the time from the morning till the afternoon because ma health is in portant.

Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine life without your computer? No? Well that's what I am trying to change. Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the @LOCATION2. goverment shows that @NUM1 people are over weight and @NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Execive comouter use will wear them out quicker than normal, where does your old word out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more your use your computer the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threwout one computer a year their would be over @NUM3 million discarded dells, gateways, macs, we would be living in trash. @CAPS1 exesive computer use ruins the environment, and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predetors, and the odds that you or your child could be tougeled skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each okey the, internet saftey level drops. Not only could these children be watching inappopriate videos on youtube or cyber bulling on @CAPS6, they could be giving personal information out to people they don't even know without realizing it on myspace and facebook, @PERCENT1 of kiddnappings are possible because of information found on the computer. Do you want any thing like that ever to happen to you or your family? I didn't think so. Get up off of your comfy computer chairs and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use, all it does is hurt you, theres no gain. Thank you for reading and don't support rapid advances in computer technology.

Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.

I believe that computers have a great effect effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1. With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is relly quite easy. Also, with @ORGANIZATION1 you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer. Well, in this commercial is laying down on and is eating an @CAPS1 cookie. While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer. Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. Such as how many points @PERSON1 got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example if I had all A's but one @CAPS2 in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get on A on it. With the help of the internet, I can do. So, now you know wh computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. As you can see now, computers are great influence to our lifestyle.

@CAPS1 that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head. You learned something new! Yipee, if it internet for computers, you would have to read those boring textbooks. Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in @NUM1 seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world! Imagine this, you need to know who the third president of the @CAPS2.S was. Are you going to go to the computer and save a bunch of time? or are you going to walk over to those miserable books? Geuss what... the capital of @LOCATION2 is @LOCATION1, the constitution of the @ORGANIZATION1 says that a person has the right to, and @PERSON1, one of @CAPS3 greatest, was assasinated in his car. If it wasn't for the internet, I wouldn't have known that. @NUM2 in @NUM3 websites on the internet are for educational value, @PERSON2, a technology major at @CAPS4 recently said, The internet is a huge chunk in education, and if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't know the things we do today. Its packed with so much to learn, its very useful to, and forces so much info into them. Lila, a technology major said, "@PERCENT1 of people communicate through computers, @PERCENT2 through phones, and @PERCENT3 through mail." @NUM4 in @NUM5 people over the age of nine, have an email. Incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday. What would it be like withour computers? Think about those numbers you just read, isnt that incredible? Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in @NUM1 seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world. If you just take a step back, you notice how valuable something really is to you."

Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are getting hooked on computers. I am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society. First off, most @CAPS1 are spending less time with friends/family and more time looking through a screen. Also, it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead. Lastly, you can get addicted to the computer. So here are my reasons why computers do not benifit our society. My first reason includes friends and family. more and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on '@CAPS2 wars.' @CAPS3 this really how we want our future generations growing up, looking blankly at computer screens? I know I don't want that. I lknow this from personal experience. When I was young, I visited my cousin @PERSON1. All I would get to see of him was a quick '@CAPS4', but then held escape to his room to continue clicking angry on the computer. The point @CAPS3 you can't replace family and friends with a computer screen. It's not right. My next argument against computers @CAPS3 about our bodies and minds. The best way to take care of those things @CAPS3 nature. Unfortunately most @CAPS1 aren't getting outside for a wack of exercise due to computers. In fact almost @NUM1 @CAPS1 say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This @CAPS3 not a good way to spend time. We need to solve this issue before more @CAPS1 make the switch from nature to computers. Fresh air, trees and birds are much better than a screen, a couple clicks, and the hum of a machine. My third and final reason @CAPS3 about addiction. So many people are getting adicted to the things they are finding on their computers. Addiction @CAPS3 a very sericuse matter that we need to fix. All of this @CAPS3 pointing to lazyness too from lack of intrest to anything else. I know this from personal experience. When my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days. All he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game. This @CAPS3 not the way to be treating a device. So, as I know you can all see computers don't have a positive impact on our society. First of all computer @CAPS3 over ruling family and friends. Also, nature @CAPS3 becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind. Lastly it's becoming a worldwide addiction. Thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that I have to offer. I know it majorly helps people keep in touch globaly, but there are other ways to do it, such as mail.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society imensely. They help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online. We need computers. Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, @CAPS1 etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. We would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. Computers benefit us by easy aces to info. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. Lastly computers let us talk to other people online. Without computers everything would be so much harder.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are good for providing us with useful information? I @CAPS2. This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers. The reasons are: They provide us with information for learning, they allow us to communicate with people, and they provide entertanment. However, I @CAPS2 understand why someone would oppose than. Let me explain my point of view. Whenever I need to @CAPS2 or know something that I don't know about, I go to my computer and look it up. Many seach engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about. Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a forgian language or even just practicing math. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @CAPS4 but he didn't have time to go to classes. So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @CAPS4 while he is home. Another reason why I think that computers benifit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people. One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can "chat" with your friends by typing in what you want to say. Another way is through video chat. This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people. I think that this is very important because @PERCENT1 of people that the computers leads people to become "anti-social". It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away. This @MONTH1 actually improve some people social if they are shy. @CAPS2 you like music, movies, and more? Well you have axcess to the through your computer. This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us. If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to @CAPS2 (if you have laptop) is put a movie in for them to watch. Another way that computer provide entertainment is they let us listen to music. If you have an ipod or @NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer. It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games. There is entertainment for everyone. Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negitive effect they have on many people. Some of those things are: people stop excersiceing and become over weight, they @MONTH1 become less interactive with other people, and they @MONTH1 not spend as much time in the fresh air. In conclution, I think that computers can benefit our society. The reason why I think this are: they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that "the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer." A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said "@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different." @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. Even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email. You can even a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. Next, we can send e-mails to other people. Have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and these is no way of finding out. Well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a from two to three cars. With e-mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message. But most likely chances are that your message wil reach its destination. can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to @LOCATION1. You can ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean @CAPS1 question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in @LOCATION2, to what an is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.
<START>

Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology.
<START>

Almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands.
<START>

Dear newspaper, I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.
<START>

I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world. It let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat. The computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convinent way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hiper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, up load picture, etc. It does alot for us. Kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that their safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hiper but the computer helps that go away. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break. The computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects. It also allows us easy information to help write the essays. Websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing. The computer is very useful when it comes to school. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life alot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definatly benefits us.

People should ues computers, they do benefit to society. More and more people use them @DATE1 and agree that these vertual portals of information and comunication are extremely helpful. Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremly helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our enviroment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternitive for paper is a computer. Once for school i was assigned a paper; i looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single peice of paper had been used! Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternitive to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was token and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screans. More and more people are coming up with beter and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will difenetly be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're enviomentaly useful and a great alternitive to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and proffesor grant states" i do all my work on the computer, without it i would be lost." And lastly they are the future of our world! They are the then now and later of the technical world.

Many people like computer and like to use them for many different kinds of reason. Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer.

@ORGANIZATION1, Are technology is advancing greately and more inventions are coming out; but aren't you worried that people spent to much time on the technology? I know @CAPS1 worried. For example computers. Computers have to technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. Thas when I get worried. In this essay I will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers. it is bad because people don't execisi enjoy mothers nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are for geting how important it is to excaise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With the computers in use people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat theire carasaprel get high and they stress more. Secondly they don't enjoy mothersnature. When people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things. Like stop going outside and getting fresh air. They get c losed in a small bubble and all they case about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do nothing. Every day they are on the computer. Finaly, one big main problem is: they stop inter acting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are oh it they don't pay attention to these young ones and they are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers they don't talk to these parents, they ignore there friends and the people that care about them most. They wont care for everybody, but them selfes @CAPS2 there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoiying mother nature, and they stop @NUM1 with family and friends. @CAPS2 what do yoo think?
<START>

I think that computers are a good thing to have because most are portable, there fun to have, and you could research a lot of thing on them. Laptops are cary round computurs. They are very convient to have. You could bring them anywhere you would like. Many people have laptops in their home or with them. There fun to have because you could play many games on your free time with them too. Another thing you could do is make videos. Last but not least you could just enjoy it. You could research a lot of things on them. Internet is a very succesful product. That means you could use it for your home work if you need help. Anthor thing is that you could type up essays that you have to do for work and or school. I think computers are good to have because most are portable, there fun to have, and you could research a lot of things on them.

Dear @CAPS1, I think that people I should they to excersize more than they go on the computer. Computer are one of the main reasons of our nations obessed rate being as big as it is now including junk foods like mcdoanld. I'm a big fan of computers myself don't get me wrong. I would on the computer all night if I could but I don't want my body out. I go to bed at @NUM1 I usally stay on the computer for an hour or two depends if I'm doing a project. Also goign on the computer less could make your life more fun instead of sitting inside go outside and play some sports like football, hang out with your friends have a @CAPS2 with your family. Do something else than be on . Conclesively, if people just puxh them selves to stay on the computer for an @NUM2 hour and a half the obessed! will go down. It could also help save our planet by saving the energy.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I think it's okay for people all over the world to use computers: The reason why I @CAPS1 this is because a lot of people us computers for a lot of things. People all over the world use computers for something important, in case of emergency and much more. Us kids/students in @ORGANIZATION1 use computers to go on myspace, facebook, and the chat lie. to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world. We also talk to our family that lives somewhre far away from the @LOCATION1 of lives here in the @LOCATION1 but in a different state. Lots of us kids go to myspace to talk to friends, family, people who we don't even know, people from all over the world and people that we havn't seen in years. Well then agian people also use computers to sell drugs which is very bad for our enviorment. This is one good reason why people are so effective and addictive to their Computers because bad people and drug dealers sell drugs over the enternet and other bad people and drug dealers buy the drugs over the enternet. As far as i know a lot people over the enternet I alson know that the people outside the enternet wouldn't do those things and even the people inside the enternet wouldn't do those bad things and sell drugs over the enternet. The reason why I know this is because they're my friends. They're smart and they just wouldn't do no such thing over the enternet or even at all. I tell you agian to my local newspaper it is okay for the people around the entire world to use any computer, @CAPS2, @NUM1 or anthing as long as they have connection but as for the drug dealers and bad people is up to than if they want to keep doing want they keep doing because eventually they will end up getting cought and getting brought to jail. I tell you that computers are meant to have fun but not meant to drugs over the enternet but anyway

Now-a-days the technological industries are taking over the modern soceity and are captivating users making them virtually addicted. What good is that? These indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies. Also if you are sitting around on the computer all day you aren't burning calories so you are gaining unnecessary weight that could easily be prevented. Going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet. lastly, have you thought of the damaging affects, trojans, cyber bullying, violence? In other words, computers are just a negative waste of good money. Families are becoming less and less connected with each other, who's to blame. It's that big book of technology on your desk. Rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away. They are teaching our family apart." @CAPS1 one @LOCATION1 man on her two tennage children's computer obsession. "I swear they're on that thing for hours on end" she claims. In an artical I was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for atleast @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are abuse take them out of your child's life, or atleast limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either over-weight or just on the boarderline of being over-wright. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty health problems. All because they didn't want to breath like. When in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task. You @MONTH1 ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting. If you are in the library you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are innappropriate. Libraries hae more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend of even be tutored. Computers dont provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atracious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong I know. I also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and im dealing with issues much better. I am @NUM2 pounds and in the best shape of my life and I even made by school's cheer team. I often go to the library to study and I must say, im very proud of who I've become. I was spending around @NUM3 hours online and getting on sleep. If I can do it you can tool my name is @CAPS2 and im a computer addiction survivor."

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 look at advances in technology over the years and can tell what an influence it has had on current day and people. The question is, are these advances for the better? Or will they take a turn for the worst? Today i will be talking to you about technology, and why i think its benefitting society poorly. With people spending less time excercising and enjoying nature, leaving ther social life behind by constanly being on the computer, they dont realize how much they're hurting themselves. The number of obese people especially in children, increases each day. This is caused by lack of excersize because some people are too busy responding to texts, talking on the phone and playing unneeded video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are definitley missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature! Why not get out for a little, escape the technology prison cell you've all been reeled into. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifuly countries in the world, take advantage that! Now, without proper excersize, your putting you heart at serious risks. Even doing smaller things, like jumping jacks or cuntups, can help make you and you heart healthy! Your parents, and even your parents parents, are who brought you into this world, faught for you in times of need, and would do anything to protect you. What would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation, never leaving you room because you playing "fun" games, hiding behind he face of technology all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializaing with the people who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends @MONTH1 be more easy going they still came that your too busy hanging out with you computer to come meet up with them @CAPS3 single person can live without a friend and that friend needs you! Make some time for the people who have a special place in you heart before they disapper. To sum it up, techology is corrupting the minds of human beings... and it need to stop! like i said be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people you are about who knows, maybe they an make you happier than your electric companion. So, fellow citizens, leap off that desk chair, shut off your electronic devices, and jump back into the real world.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could "take control" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier.

Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 computers have really change the way people use technology. It has made our society different in many ways. People can look at information faster than ever with this device. People can also talk to friends, especially on popular websites, computers are even used in school, mostly in college. @CAPS1 an advantage of using it in school, means so much to the people and there education, computers have changed the human race forever. When my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. their guide was priar knowledge, knowledge from a teacher, or a dictionary. We are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer. @CAPS1 access to a computer can really help people inso many different ways, mainly about the world. What is the first place you would go to talk to people online: @CAPS2. Do you man @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have @CAPS2. The reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too. From my experience out from canada have @CAPS2 too, which is surprising. Talking to in country is unbelievable. As you're opportunity for people to make new friend. This can also affect the way people lively. When teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of talking a specific, almost like a helping one classes is because when you are in college, so many in a short amount. I have people who stay up for our their paper. @CAPS1 these are an advantage for everyday life, especially college because it is an oppurtunity for someone to get better at typing computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and get a caple more hours of sleep! In conclusion, I believe @CAPS1 computers effect our society in a positive way. Thank your for reading this letter, and I hope you can take this into consideration. @CAPS1 computers have dramatically changed lives forever.

Dear, @CAPS1 paper edattor we should stop because people arent doing anything their just staying home using the computer. Making there life worser they should make a day whith out computors and every one goes out side and gets exsesise. Wo could mapse the world better the more you. Exersise the stronger you get people livse computers because they could there frends play games thats but some time we have to go outside. Some times i like using the computer but a littile to much land that i dont get that mach exesersise and i hope i could stop from that and go out side and exersise more. We would have computers but we wont use it like for along time then spend more outside. We should only olw kids for only two or three hours a day. When there using the computer they use over like hours thats not good they should go out side thats why.

Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a exellent benefit for people. First family friends can communicate from a far distance. Secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. Thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1 do you think? Researcher @PERSON1 said that almost @PERCENT1 of family's live faraway from eachother. computers give the ability for familys to communicate wether its aim or a webcam chat. Also out of the @PERCENT1 of familys that live faraway from each other @PERCENT2 use the computer to comunicate. Hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. Good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. For example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. For example in the third grade I had to research hammer head sharks. Don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer? As I have said before I think computers have a benifit on people. I hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friend and hand and eye cordnation and lastly researching has made you think it a good thing too. Thank you for taking time to read @CAPS1 I had to say and I hope you take it into concideration.

Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity

Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people as posotive I say that it is posotive because what if your in a rush, and you don't know if you need your rain boots or not? Check the computer! I say that it is posotive because without the computer how would most offices run their buisness? It's too much of a pain to keep everything on files. Especially in schools because the teachers don't keep their grades for students in a filing cabinet! They keep them on the computer, @CAPS1 they'd need a huge filing cabinet. I could understand why some peole think computers have a bad effect on people. They might think that it takes away time from nature, friends and family. But so many people take their laptops to the local park to sit under a tree on warm days and go on the computer there. Especially students do this, they do their homework under the leaves to help them relax. Also, people whose family or friends live in other states, they @MONTH1 not have the house number, or they don't have time for a long conversation, they can e-mail them, or use social networking like facebook, or myspace to look on their profile pages and say a quck, "@CAPS2, how are you doing?" Local shop owner @PERSON1 says, "I barely have time for myself! So when I want to say @CAPS2 to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually say hello on facebook because I know how she loves to talk my ear off!" I remember one morning, when I was rushing before school, I had no idea what type of outfit to wear. I checked the local news casting website for the weather forecast and thank god I did! I would have gotten stock in downpour without an umbrella! Computers are also good for if you want to catch up on any news, or just relax and play some games you can. So, if your wondering about the weather to see if today will be a good day to sit under the trees in the park & catch up on typing that report with your partner, then go ahead. But don't forget to e-mail her and ask her first, since you lost her phone number.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concern with these @NUM1 people, computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including it can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn abour faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people. First of all, its's a proven fact that most sports on physical exercise to involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help reach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination. When a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard. This takes alot of coordination if you think about why don't even love to look at the mouse on keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is. People disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend to much time on the computers they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand-eye coordiantion people learn on the computer help to improve their skill and coordiantion in sports, for example in baseball a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the samee time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is were the hand-eye coordiantion helps. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand-eye coordiantion. In addition to this @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They give people acess to information about a foreign place or people be available in or other resources areas. On the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search and they have dozens of with information of that place and pictures, @CAPS2 are a society that is advencing in technology people are learnings learn and they can wtih great the of a button. In addition is think it's also a tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer. Computer benefit society in the way that they can teach about different loaction and people. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and @MONTH1 be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact with people online, whether it was through email or facebook. Computers allow people to take online with other people. In our modern society it is very important that a person has friends, are great why to keep in with friends, if live very far away from you on it haven't to them in a while connecting them on the computer is a great way to keep i touch. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe taht is just the opposite. Since @CAPS2 are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country. Having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other. People talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. Its now or never! Computers can have benefit society. They reach people hand-eye coordiantion can be use all through our life. Most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Lastly they allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 are living a modern time, society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people.

Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important. First of playing sports is far and youve health but people never play sports anymore just because computer for example @NUM2 people stop playing sports, secondly going to is very import because is good.

I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. All these things are good so why not use computers, we need computers. Do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? After you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect. Computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example: school, work, talk to other, and just get information. From different websites. If we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books. We would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer. We probably would not know that much if it wasn't ofr computers. The reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands. That proves hand-eye coordination. We learn about places we don't live in like that? Had a earthquake we went on websites for that. You get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for. You get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity. Computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact. Now we have @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and others. We use that to talk to our friend and family. Some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk. If you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business. You can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities. You can even play games on the computer. You can explore nature on the computer. I think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. Do you want your child to learn? Do you want your child to have fun? So tell me what you think! Computers have a positive effect.
<START>

I believe that computers have a negitive effect on people. Using the computer effects a person's time because the sit for hours playing online games, @CAPS1 also effects there heath because there not getting any fresh air or spending time with there family, lastly @CAPS1 effects there education because time they could be using doing there homework there on there computer. First useing the computer effects a person's time, @CAPS1 does that by wasteing hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something good, wasted because of the computer. The computer also effects you heath because your in a room inside not getting any air. You're also not exerciceing and helping your body out. This could effect your emotional heath. When your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family. When you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then @CAPS1 will become worse. My last reason is that @CAPS1 effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studing for an important lest on your on the computer learning nothing, then you will school and possably mess for ever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades drops alot. So this is why @CAPS1 effects education. These are the reasons how the computer effects education, your heath, and your time. I know your thinking that computers could be used for education, but humans prefer fun over anything else and I hoped this helped you realized that.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.

Dear editor, Computers are a waste of time. When kids get home from school they put their name work down and go right on the computer. Computers are wasting minds of little kids, while others dont even bother to look outside because they are on the computer. If there is only one computer in your house and are no time limits on how long you have to be on, can cause problems between siblings or adults. If your brother or sister has been on the computer for really long and you want to go on and have no more parents, there probably will be some fighting and yelling. Also, if somebody does somthing that they werent suppose to do on the computer, that messed it up, the person that is always fixing it can get really mad. "@CAPS1 a nice day outside" is what alot of people get from there parents. Most people just waste away the day by sitting on the computer w/ there favorite snack. Alot of people wont even look out side because they are to lazy to get up off of the computer, and go for a walk or maybe play in the snow. My little brothers like to play shooting games on the computer, they are only @NUM1 @NUM2 years old! They are twins so they like the same stuff so, they both enjoy killing people in games. Im pretty sure that almost every other boy out there around there age, feel the same way. My point is these games are teaching the kids nothing. All @CAPS1 teaching them is how to kill people or animals, or do dangerous things were they would hurt themselves. I hope my letter showed people that computers can hurt other people and they waste your life and instead of going to the park w/ your family your spending that time on the computer. Most of the time it has a negative effect on people which isnt very good.

Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don’t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can’t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4’s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.

Dear @CAPS1, I beleive that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects of places you think are interesting you don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know any thing about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter "@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2" in a google search, and press enter. There you here hundreds even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit forever and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at anytime. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Seond, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees we are harming our environment. We are depleeting our oxygen supply and destroying habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use to send documents and papers, we could bring to tax appointments and pair suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could asign the homework email it to the student the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure we would still have to use paper for somethings, but we would be using in way less. People could also use less fossil. We could talk via the internet and things like skype to communicate witness waring to and burn. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel and even every day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also hep us find more efficient way. They could help find a mroe efficient feel, efficient of it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every day life. When you get up in the @TIME1, imagein being able to screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of any reasons for having computers from school reasearch to space and beyond.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In @CAPS2 opinion, computers are fantastic! Therefore, I believe computers have a great effect on peoples life. Three reasons to support @CAPS2 decision are many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it and it is a big help at home/around the house. @CAPS2 first reason is, that many jobs in the state, or nation use a computer. Statistically saying @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware. If you honestly think about it, if you were a teacher, a factory employee, etc, you practicly wouldn't even be able to do your job without it. We have learned alot from the new inventions that came about in the past decade, or two. If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be the "@CAPS1 the time you spend on the computer, but go on because you will learn some things you never know before." @CAPS2 second reason is we have alot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only resort was...books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now theres no table of contents, just a link and a click! @CAPS2 third reason is it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can help with so many things. Including, help with the children, help with cooking, with organizing, anything! Let's say you don't know what time "@CAPS3's" friends birthday party starts, no worrys just ask his mom on @CAPS4! Or you need a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This makes life alot easier and puts a extraordinary effect on your life! In conclusion, having a computer in your life is great, because so many jobs use computers, theres so many searching things, and it is helpful at home. So, computers have a awesome effect on people's lives!!

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that computers effect people? I think I @CAPS1 agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 agree with this statement because people dont get use to doing other things then stay on the computer. One example is that people that @CAPS1 stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people. They wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer. First of all, people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on othe poeple. I know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One idea in that there not alot to do on a computer for some people. People dont go out and have fun like going to the mall with your friends. Some people try to focused on the computer if theres something importent they have to do. Thirldy, people wont enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer I really dont enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you wont want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when ther going to the beach. People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day. Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it. Lastly, doctors say its not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around. Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer. You need to do healthy things to help your body. In conclusion, I had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun. You wont enjoy yourself, and doctors. Say its not good for you I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are all around us where ever you go. You can learn things on them or play games. Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because, harmful people could findout where you live and they are too addicting. Where ever you look you can find a computer. At home, in school, in your car, at work, and hotels. Being exposed to these computers are helpful. Everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer. In the future we are going to see more and more computers. Buisnesses practically run off of computers, soon they will run them by thereself. Also with so many computers it creates jobs. You can make computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them doing work. Even though everyone says they are safe on the computer, they are not. While on a chatting website you could meet someone and they might be a child melestor or a. They can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone. With your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints. Then they can come and leave you mentally scared for life. There are tons of things you can do on a computer. For example you can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning. Either way games on the computer are too addicting. You say you are going to play for @NUM1 minutes but they are so addicting you play for @NUM2 hours. The games just suck you in and your stuck. Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because harmful people can find out where you live and they are too addicting. Computers are good and bad at the same time. People need to know when to stop using it or it can drasticly change your life.

Dear local newspaper, I strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes. My opinion for having computers is I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise. You would just sit there looking at the computer all day. You would probley get all fat through the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you. My last opinion is if we have computer. We won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You wont be able to see how big your family is. Or how small they are still small. Well these are my opinion's for having computers.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think that the effect is good because every place needs them they store thing neatly that way you will know that when you go back it will be neat and saved. Every place uses computers they are a big thing. Hotels use them to save who's in each room and to actuvate the room keys, restarunts use them to help make the bill, hospilas use them to store flies so they can be printed heat so the doctor can go to look at them and understand. And schools use them they need them to store grades neatly, or for an student to to type up a paper neatly and hand it in they could leave it for the day and go back to it tomorrow. The computer can also be you job, like you workinh on them like fixing them or installing a @ORGANIZATION1 programor app. You can also do your work on it like working on a website or once agin just writing a boper. The biggest company @MONTH1 need an computer even the @ORGANIZATION1 need them they are big in you company. So even people don't get outside enought the computer help you to make money or be sucsseful in life and once yo got that money thek you will go out side in speed it. So computers have a big effect on schools, communy, stores and many other pplaeces and peoples life.

Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!
<START>

The local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers do have effect on people. People can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Read on so you can learn how computers effect people lifes. My first reason is people can meet new people. You can meet new people from all around the world. You can keep touch with them through @CAPS1 or e-mail. Its a quicker and new way to meet new people. My second reason is you can learn about new places. You can learn new places by just clicking on an webpage. Computers are a faster way to learn. I gives you everything you need to know about the ne places you want to learn about. My third reason is we can talk to friends. Computers have many diffrent social websites that you can talk to people. You wont have to wait for school the next day you can talk to them through the computer. With all this new / quicker stuff you can talk to friend when ever you want. Finally, you know how computers affect people. We can meet new people, learn new places, and talk to friends. Computers can do all these days. Hope you enjoyed reading all about how they affect people.

Dear @CAPS1 people, Your have been told that using a @CAPS1 can give no knolege, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye cordanation, A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on facebook, myspace and even twitter to talk to your friends. Its the most common thing to go on the @CAPS1. About @PERCENT1 teens and adults use myspace and facebook. Litter kids would be like @PERCENT2 use @CAPS2 to interact with some friends. This technology is the most best thing you could ever use. The second reason is, that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and the hand-eye cordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories, using @ORGANIZATION1 word, and even learning whats to use on the internet, for hand-eye cordination, you can learn all the keys an the keyboard and what they do to get better skills. My thirdly reason is, how to search on google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most common thing that everyone uses. To look up pictures for projects, labs basiclly for anything. And for the dictionary, you can see what words mean and the dictionay is for learning and doing homework. For my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet, everyone do you want education or not? computers help everyone. You gotta love it!?!
<START>

More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to "busy" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers.
<START>

Dear, Who ever this concerns Some people are to obssesed with computers. They usually stay up all night playing games or going on @CAPS1. The people who love computers rarely iteract with people they like to be left alone with no one bothering them. Some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them. If you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep then you miss work and you get tired then you know you have a problem so quit. You dont want to stay up al night. Because you could have something important to do and you miss it like your childs party becuse you husband or wife typed to wake you up. But you didn't want to go you miss it and your child never trust you again when you stop interacting with other people you really got a problem because you need want to go any were but to get junk food and soda. Computers all the time is bad for you sometime you get cranky when someone takes it away that is when you need to realize what you are doing and go get some exercise is what you need you got to get some or you end up unhealthy which is bad for you and you want to stop that habit and get a new one. When your write a report you tend to go to the internet. It @MONTH1 be agood sorce but it could be lying and you could turn in the worst report ever you @MONTH1 of copy and pasted but you could still the not have to be your reliable sorce use your use a good good book. The internet is a bad thing it could consume you don't use it all the time the people make computer should shut all the computers world for one week so we know how it is with out internet.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people

To whom this @MONTH1 concern Computers are a great source of technology, but many people spend to much time on them. People don't get to see the out-side world because they are to "busy" on their computers, and use them to find things or play games that they can do just outside in the fresh air. Computers are and people spend to much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talk and bonding with their family and friends. First of all, people don't enjoy nature as much as they enjoy their computers. When you're stuck in side school or work, you don't get to go outside and see the natural beauty of nature, so when you get out take @NUM1 minutes or so to go and enjoy the wilderness. You don't have to go outside every day, but once in a while it feels good to get out and explore the world. Expecially when you had a little break and what to be alone, in nature, you can get away and lose your stress. Some @MONTH1 say you can enjoy nature and explore new places online, and yes you wouldn't you want to do it first-hand? You don't get the real experience by just looking at pictures. You have to be their and explore it by yourself. In nature there is always some thing new. Secondly, when you are on your computer, you didn't doing anything your body, you need to go exercise. Fresh air is good for you, you. Spending most of your time on your computer, you don't spend time with your family and friends. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you get older, the time you have with your family get less and less. You also @MONTH1 see you friends in school or at work everyday but you don't really get to sit and "catch up" with each other. Online their are programs where you can chat with friends and family, but wouldn't you want to see them personaly, especially if you don't see them everyweek. It's a better experience and you made many more moments. Just going out far which or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones. In conclusion, people spend to much time on their computers. They don't get to experience the outside world and the wonders of nature. The more on their computers, the less exercise they get and less fresh air. Family and friends some of the greatest things in your life, dont get to bond with you,. Computers are good for using spread sheets and typing essays, but they aren't good for you to spend all your time on, mailing it, and missing out on the adventures your life will venture through

Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in there ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on "@CAPS4 @DATE1." A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today.

To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, "@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers!

Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the @CAPS1 is a good way for people to connect with one each other. But it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online like looking at things they shouldn't be looking at strangers they shouldn't be talking or typing to or even predators that could be online. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids and adults go on the computer either when their getting out @ORGANIZATION1 school for the day or if they are getting off @ORGANIZATION1 work for the day or if they are getting off @ORGANIZATION1 work for the night, they are just there on the computer to check upon things and for the kids either for their entertainment, for like chatting with friends on some king @ORGANIZATION1 program, or @ORGANIZATION1 their even playing a game online. Three fourths @ORGANIZATION1 kids under age @NUM1 go online more than adults age @NUM2 because @ORGANIZATION1 the interest in what is on it. People sometimes say, "oh, I only go on the computer to check up on things. It only takes me a few minutes", But they are lying. Most people dont just go on for a couple @ORGANIZATION1 minutes, their on for more like a few hours, and that effect their relationship or connection to ones family and or friends. @PERSON1 at the @ORGANIZATION1 says, "people spend hours on the computer looking at what ever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake @ORGANIZATION1 the persons family and friends," @PERSON1 also said," @CAPS2 like an addiction". Do you really want to have an addiction? I didn't think so, so instead @ORGANIZATION1 just sitting there storing into a screen for hours aday go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the @CAPS3, the beach, even just take a walk in the park. Nothing can beat the feeling @ORGANIZATION1 being with friends or family and just having fun.

@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About @PERCENT1 of my class has computers. So many people have them because their helpful and another current learning resource. Also it's a great way to keep in touch with friends. Although they can be time consuming they make up for it in the long run. First, they are helpful because it's quick an easy to get from page to page. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients. You can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with school or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad acession and we need to be saving every penny. These are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and. Those out dated articles don't have accurate more researched information But, computers do so you can compare your information. Also there are online schoold that are affordable. So if you want to get more of an education but, you have to work too. This helps a great deal. A computer can be used for many things like learning. Computers are definetly the best way to keep in touch with friends and family that you aren't able to see very often. I know what your probably thinking, is that well isn't that what phones are for. No because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone. Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, facebook, aim, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in awhile. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource. I just want to remind you that their helpful a great learning resource, and a great way to stay in touch. Computers are now an important piece of Society. Computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers effect people, well I don’t agree with that statement. Here are my @NUM1 reasons why. Computers and other technology make the way easier. Talking to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.

Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1" or "@CAPS2" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like "@CAPS3" and "@CAPS4" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or "@CAPS5" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say, "@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily" The reccomened time limits is @NUM2 hour. By spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers cant be good. First off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes effects <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without "roughing it." You can go to the or to the aquarium. Sit on your back pond and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes you can email, I. M., @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. Mainly of socia skills. We need to the of social without computer. In conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. People aren't exersising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally their bonds between friends and family are weahiming. This is a growing problem which must be put to end. Thank you for your time.

The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. Though these divices @MONTH1 seem entertaining and helpfull. Well that is not all true. Computers are being used for more then just work. It seems to be the peoples new way of comunication. Communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives. There is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others. Though computers seem to abuse the privlage of communication. For talking on an online chat sight is easier and more convient for people. The people in those charts are not always sho they claim to be. This pushes a huge danger on those signts @CAPS3 children of all ages now are using them. These children fo not always know who they are talking to, but @CAPS3 its online they say anything that into their mind. The way @CAPS2 talk tao people in person is not the same on line. When communicating with people on the computer the writer tends to short hand things. Such as the word "you" would be spelled "u". These quick changes happen without thinking, and become a natural habit. These changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing. So instead of seeing the sentence "@CAPS1 did you think about her project", @CAPS2 will see "wat did u tink bout her pro." @CAPS3 of this many childrens grades could be affected. For their spelling will soon become and the vocabulary will be, or all in slang. This vocabulary change could be prevented if computer were not used as much. Today @CAPS2 are seeing going outside. No one ever needs to go anywhere if all theire communication can be done at home. This isn't just hurting ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside the more energy is being wasted. The times @CAPS2 do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the to make a garden, plant some tree's or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If @CAPS2 would all just take the time, maybe only ten minutes adays to help our environment it would be helping our bodies and also helping our planet. This would reduce the amount of people using computer's and change the way @CAPS2 see our civilization today. So please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but @CAPS2 only have one of us and one ofour planet. @CAPS2 dont want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology.

I think we need our computers. If we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. I no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. These reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things.
<START>

Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think.

Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time in their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. I agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on. Though the @CAPS3 users think there is nothing, negative about using the computers but there is. Such as increase light bill payment, obesity and like the experts said, "@CAPS1 time interacting with family and friends." @CAPS2, @CAPS3 users of the computer cause light bill because if the user are constantly on, then computer must cnstantly be on, when the computer in constantly on, it causes the light bill to increase. I can connect to that because I used to be a @CAPS3 user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it. Ever since I had brought down the habbit od being a @CAPS3 user my guardian has stated the light bill gas decreased. Another reason why @CAPS3 user of the computer must decrease thier habbit is because of obesity. Obesity is when a man or women is overwieght. My imaginary friend is a @CAPS3 user in my imagination. He is light many others, he never exerciszes with his friends because he is constantly on the computer. Last but not least,@CAPS3 begin to slack on interesting with friends and family. As I stated in paragraph two that I used to be a @CAPS3 user. I myself wouldn't accept invitation to couldn't go to movies with friends and I wouldn't help around the house. These were the main three thing I wouldn't do. Then I learned to not abuse the computer, not waste my time on it. but I also learned to be responsible with it. That's what I think many @CAPS3 should do to. In conclusion, being sa constantly user is not healthy because it many cause obesity. Also, a @CAPS3 user increased light bill, and wont spend time interacting.

@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good.

Dear newspaper, People are spending to much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?
<START>

What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computer in general. People might say that computers are great to be on its fast and you get what you need but I think computers are not good they become addicting and make your bills every high, computers can lead to your child sending less time with you and your family, also computers can be very danerous for teens and children of all ages. I say that computers are addicting this is a fact @PERCENT1 of students spend most of there time on the computer. Why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world. Now I know it might not sound bad but this can be bad for your pocket @PERSON1 who works with electrion bills says that because children spend more time on the computer the bills in house have grown up almost @PERCENT2 and the harder it is for people to pay there bills. Computers are what they say now a days are one of the main reason children spend less time with there family. This is true in most familys like mine because pof computers me and my sisters spend more time on then computer than with each other this can cause argueing and fughting between familys. Statics show that @NUM1 people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents. Is this what you want for your you and your children to be separated by tecongly? Computers aren't always safe for teens and children of all ages. There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens. I say this because sometimes we are worried about are kids safty and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about. Teens are most/likely going to met other people online and there are stalkers, posers, and other people out there that are pretending to be soomeone they are not and your child can be one of those peoples who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kiddnapped, rapped anyting can happen. Children can be always get hurt by verbal abuse they can be threatened by others and hurt and that can cause emotional damage so be careful and monitor your child. These are just very few things that can happen. These are my reason computers aren't the really benefiting are society.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because, you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could effect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can't @CAPS3 on the computer. You said why todays a nice day. Then your friend said @CAPS3 playing games. Thats an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer. Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldnt be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot. If you are in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and this happens you wouldnt be alowd to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computers is important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 you still shouldn't be on it to long. In conclusion everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people.

Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothinggood comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from in other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, your hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while your using the computer it's entertaining, for example, your on @CAPS1 and your talking to your friend and your laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person, you might as well see them in person. There for, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Copmputers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not realiable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. There for, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on then and it's bad for your health. There for, computers have negative effects on people.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simple pushing a button. This has became posible with the computer. I support the advances on technology because computer can help hand eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why it support the computer. First, the computer benifits society because it developes hand eye cordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand eye coordination. Bill @CAPS2, creator of @ORGANIZATION1, "The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand eye cordination." This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand eye cordination. @CAPS3 I can type with my eyes closed. I understand how you might think that computers cause people to not get enough exercise, however, the computer can improve your hand eye coordination. This is why I support the computers. Next I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when the to learn a place or a person. @PERSON3 stated, "The way students study is much different than it used to be, @CAPS3 students use computers." This reminds me of when recently I had a report to do on @PERSON1 and all needed was my computer. I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying natures is imprtant, intelegence is even more important . This is why the computer supports our society. Finaly, I support the computer you can talk to the world instantly. Did you know that ninety-nine out of our hundred students talk online to in touuchscreen. @PERSON2, creator of @CAPS4, an instant messaging website, stated, "@CAPS5 is no doubt that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch with , This reminds me of when I went away on vacation and still stayed in touch with my friends through @CAPS4. I understand how exercise is essential to your body, however, talking with friends is important too. This is why I support the computer. In conclusion, I support the computer because it support hand eye coordination, you can learn about faraway places and people, and you can communicate with people around the world. @CAPS3 that you knew why I support the computer @CAPS5 should be no doubt that you will support it.

Dear @CAPS1 I support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and lot more. The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneer who have changed humanity. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @CAPS6 third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @CAPS5, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball @CAPS6 idols are @PERSON1 peterson and @PERSON2 iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of @CAPS6 idols. @CAPS6 last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is.

Dear Newspaper, "@CAPS1 a computer @CAPS15?" @CAPS2’s a continous subject and @CAPS10 controveries and ideas have been made, like senior scientis @PERSON2, I believe that computer can be used to help people connect with friends, long distant relatives" says @PERSON2. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 right, computers bring people together whether its friends families or relatives from far countries. @CAPS2 also helps with everyday needs like and homework. First off people can do @CAPS10 things on a computer, including homework finding a store and checking out traffic and weather. You can play games, connect with friends learn recipies and react if the wreckers the football game. @CAPS4 creating a link all around the world people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about. @PERCENT1 of large corporations find the @CAPS3 and computer very useful. "@CAPS4 using the @CAPS3 I can find a willing participant in charities" says @PERSON4, charity fund raiser in @LOCATION1. Second, @CAPS4 using the @CAPS3 people can share their wares on @CAPS10 sites including @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. People also create websites to share their wares, @PERSON1 the co-owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct @CAPS8 wallet company that also raises money for @LOCATION2, has started to create a website, and hopes to raise awareness of the terrible event that happened." @CAPS10 like @PERSON1 use the @CAPS3 to expand their buisness. "@CAPS12 stay in the past, when the door to the future @CAPS1 open?" @CAPS13 @PERSON3, the succesful owner of @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 using computers, people can gather data from others and create new inventions to help the world. People can create @NUM1-@CAPS14 diagrams on a computer and send the data to a company, and hopefully create @CAPS2. Computers arent just same plaything, they are serious pieces of equipment that can help the world. Although @CAPS10 people might find the down sides to computers, they will always be able to think of a good side. I hope that you will use this article to prove that computers arent all @CAPS15.

Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes @MONTH1 have to go on the for example @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their.

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less “cyberspace” bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says “@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they don’t. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diebeties. It’s imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. “In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don’t go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use the socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sisters friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on advil so @CAPS3 ran comitt suicside because of cyber bullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should "go die in a hole." @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing website than less people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the peabody museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity was invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in todays homes is used on computers. Also my grandmother is astounded by what todays technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremly imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health their self estem and environment. A case take action to stop using computer @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper.

Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definetely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising. I mean, who would give up their chatrooms and games to get in shape? I remember when i was a little girl - about @NUM1 years old, and i always wanted to be on the computer. I soon got chubby and gained about @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary. because it shortens activity time. A survey done by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 between ages @NUM3 are overweight because of their computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 says. "I keep going and losing weight because of computers! I will gain weight and then run it off and ignore the computer for a week." I know you might be thinking that computers dont make you obese if you use it sparingly, but research has proven that more than @NUM4 mins a day can make you gain fat. Clearly, computers are to blame for our society's weight problem. Have you ever really seen nature's beauty? People who use computers don't! I mean, people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate. the outside world. I remember when i watched the movie @CAPS2 last week, I thought to myself, "@CAPS3, nature is amazing, why didn't I notice before?" I already know the answer. Computer, A survey conducted by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 showed that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the blooming flowers or the smell of fresh rain. Famous physician, @PERSON4, "@CAPS4 that dont see nature for its true beauty often can't grow up normally. People were supposed to be naked to nature, but over the years, technology has diminished that connection." I know you @MONTH1 that that @CAPS4 see enough of nature even with computers but more than often., @CAPS4 dont pay attention to nature. They are too busy with computers. Obviously, nature is ignored by society because of computers. Familes grow more and more detached every time a child or even adult uses a computer. I mean, every time you hit that on switch, you and the computer become attached. You can't focus on the people around you. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she never took her eyes off the computer. She would play solitore and instant message her friends all the time and she then completely disconnected with the family. A test done by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens will rebel @NUM9 times more than usual with the aid of a computer. Famous talk-show host, @PERSON3 says, "@CAPS4 shouldn't use computer, they will get detached from friends and family." I know you're thinking @CAPS4 dont get detached, but they di. Clearly @CAPS4 seperate from their friends and family because of computers. In conclusion, any far minded person can tell that computers have a negative effect on people because they consume exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and seperate family and friends. Therefore, I urge you to not use computers!

Computers are very enchanced pieces of machinery. With this high-@CAPS7 object comes knowledge of many different places and what is happening around the world. Next, typing is a universal way of writing that is much faster than hand-writen pieces. Lastly, @CAPS5 is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world. These are thousands of news sbrics, evey day of the year that do not ultimately get coverd because of limited are time on news channels. To quickly and simply get your news from around the world you can visit a website and lock at hundreds of stories at the click of a button. To add to that, you will get more in-depth news for these is no limit on room or space on the website. These will even be areas on the website to donate to the that need assistance. patrick @PERSON3, founder of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, stated", @CAPS4 bring in billions at dollars in aid to people who otherwise would be in deep trouble, and the main source of all of this money is from internet websites."@CAPS3 the internet, millions of people would not even know about these people who desprately need help. Typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write, that saves people valuable time. Teaches often assign writing homework, which takes about twice as long to hand-write other than type. Using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed. Furthermore, typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students. "@CAPS4've had many students,"says typing intruder @PERSON2, and the ones that excel not only get an 'A', but also cut there homework time in half. Stress is a common problem in all age groups, and a computer is the best way to releive @CAPS5. Interactive game with people around the world will broaden your specturm to other cultures. You way use your typingskills to talk with others, and share your opinions with them."@CAPS5 @MONTH1 seem a shock," says @PERSON1 at @CAPS6 @CAPS7", but people who use computers an hour a day are much more culturaly advanced that the others."To add to that, you can use video chat to talk to people in foreign areas. Friends, family, and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat. This greatly reduces parent stay of their children living in a foreign country.Many people

Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a @ORGANIZATION1 work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (@ORGANIZATION2). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @CAPS1 but you can't call them because you live all the way in the @LOCATION1 And if you call them, it'll cost you about @MONEY1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up @ORGANIZATION1 "yoga" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up @ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also get @ORGANIZATION1 work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3. And it is more and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the @ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind.

Should there be computers in are society. Yes, there should computer are good things and are good help. I can give you @NUM1 good reasons why. Paying bills, facebook, and research. This is why computers are good. My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills its easier to pay your bills online then to do all the paper work, and it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them thats why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have facebook. And thats a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have facebook and just interact with people and why computers are good in society. My thrid reason why we should have computers in are society is because research and need to get info from and an computer is really good help for that, there great help for research like an specific topic the computer has all that. In conclusion having computers is really good because of paying your bills, facebook, and research, so people need computers so I told you all good things about computers can you tell me yours!!

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I you to be in of negative effects on people. @CAPS1's important decision is up to you.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, To start off I would like to give my opinion on using compuers too much. Although I use a computer a lot I still have fun with friends and play sports. But to much time on the computer can cause you noth wanting to get exercise or maybe getting sick easier. Spending so much time on the computer can cause a kid to be shy in the outside life. Exerasing is very healthy for kids and adulst. there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours. Staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape. People should have a minimal amount of time of @NUM1 minutes each day and then get some exercise. this way you would get time for being on the internet and still doing what's good for you, I shouldn't feel bad about the people who waste all their time on the computer but I do. To see them getting gross and gaining weight from lack of exercise makes we want to help htem @CAPS4 one should put themselves into that kind of situation. What I've noticed about people who stay online a lot is that they get sick more often. From sitting there like lazy bums they don't get fresh-air. Not getting enough fresh-air can cause a cold or for some people with problems to get very sick. They need to think twice about what they're getting themselves into. I would rather be having fun and getting nice fresh-air then sitting on the computer about to be sick. It can be a different story if you went home sick from work/school and went on the computer. but being sick from the computer is gross. Even though to say, people who are on the computer often are shy in person. If someone gets in a fight on the internet that can cause them so much pain to not even talk. Interacting with people is very nice and touching. But being shy and lonely because of a fight on the computer or from being on it too much, is something to be ashamed of you shouldn't have to be that way because of one thing. Get out in the world and don't let things like that get to you. To this off, it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long. Remind yourself to have atleast @NUM1 minutes to yourself and to do waht you want but get some exercise also. Don't forget about staying healthy and going for a jog once in a while. You shouldn't focus your life on your computer. Thank you and have a great day.

I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes.

Welcome to the @DATE1. In this day in age, numerous advances in technology are being made everyday. The one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer. For just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: @CAPS1 access for educational purposes, keeping people in touch, and opening people up to new aspects of life. The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday.

Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults love going on the computer, but they don’t know what the bad effects are. When your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things I mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them. Also you could harass people or get harrassed yourself. And you can go on inapropriate websites. Secondly, you act enough generation child I go outside basically, it all kids. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones, and laptops; kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the times not good because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, harrassment, and you can go on inappropriate websites. you won't get enough exercise and you can suffer from diabetes, high and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family times mainly because of all of the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are wonderfull to the society in many ways. They can keep memories we cant keep forever like @CAPS3, @CAPS1's, and type letters. Computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals. But, important of all of it, family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill. To begin, computer can give you @CAPS2 tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center. For example: your extremely stresed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are a millions websites you could go to find your answers on. The next day you get your paper back and theres a A stamped right across it. Another @CAPS2 thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city, town, state, or even content! you @MONTH1 miss them alot but you can always see them to them or type to them to let that sad feelings melt away for a little bit. Every @NUM1 in @NUM2 americans say missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what its like to have a memory that you could never forget:  but what about those little memories that @CAPS3, websites, and written work seems to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that so the "I know its to its like to loose its like a little part of life that you have lived walks always" exclaims @PERSON1 who could This is exactly why computer in many ways. I hope you are @CAPS2 for the mind, tips and family.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, Have you seen someone with a @CAPS1 emailing their co-worker or a person with their laptop at a coffee shop? Well, I can @CAPS4 I have and know they need and it benefits them. People everday use a computer for their work. Also, you can keep in touch with friends and family. Plus, it's the start to new improved future! whether you use a computer to get the latest gossip or for a job, the computer is now an important part of people's lives. My mother works on the computer everyday at her job, though it @MONTH1 not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills. Half of @LOCATION1 uses computer for jobs for money just like my family. Recently, @ORGANIZATION3, the computer company took a survey to see how many people use the company for work. A whopping amount of @PERCENT1 use the computer for work. That @PERCENT1 of people benefit from using the computer. They depend on their email to get to their boss or their layout of their statewide meeting to save so they can get the raise they deserve. You the, @ORGANIZATION1 even uses computers to write your articles for the paper. More than half of @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION2 benefit just from working on the computers. Everyone says family is the most important thing right? What can yo do if they live far away? Well you email, @CAPS5, @LOCATION2M, or @CAPS3 of course. Some experts @CAPS4,"People are spendiong too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family." @CAPS5 is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family. So the experts have no reason to @CAPS4 that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families. Even people in the army use the comptuer to communicate. Using the computer isn't as bad as people think. Look out! The future is coming! New technology greater than my knowledge is coming. Computers were the start and people haven't stoped since. Sure, of course the computer has a couple downsides. But what thing or invention doesn't. No one can stop what is coming, you just have to learn to live with it and move on. Computers are the beginning to something good so don't stop something that could be even better! Next time you go outside look for that guy in the business suit emailing on the @CAPS1 or the girl in the coffee shop and smile, know they are benefitting from it. Whether it's for work or the one keeping in touch with a relative. Maybe someone with the next big idea for the future. Take a chance on the computer, stop the negativity and a pleasant surprise will come your way.

Dear The Local Newspaper, I do @CAPS1 computers effect people. But in many different ways. Also, depending on how long you are on the computer for. In my opinion @CAPS1 computers are good, for many reasons. I will tell you some of the reasons why I @CAPS1 this. Hopefully, after you read this you'll @CAPS1 about it more. One reason computers are good, is the communication. @CAPS2 are many different web sites to go on and talk to friends and family. If you had a family member far away, this could be a good way to talk to them. This also is a way to see your friends with the latest technology you can videchat. Videochat is a way to see and hear your friends by a little camera. It is a very good way to keep intouch with people you know. Another reason is that you can get a lot of information from the computer @CAPS2 are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 recommend other sites to go resaerch. You can learn a lot from computers. The information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something. Lastly, a computer can help you with many things. Such as online classes, matchmakeing, jobs, and so much more. You can find things to do, by just typing it into the computer. The economy is very bad, but you can look for jobs. Then once they find one your interested in they'll tell you. It's a very good and helpful way for you, and it's so simple. Computers are an amazing, and new technology. They keep coming up with more and more. So why not use it? It can teach you something and help you. Also, to stay in touch with family and friends. Don't take it for advantage, but use it well. It's only a click of a button. I hope I made you all realize what a computer is really @CAPS2 for. Maybe, even changed your minds or gave you a different way of thinking about computers.

Dear @CAPS1, Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now making life much easier for everyday people. It helps out in many ways for example, to keep in touch with relatives, to learn new information and to keep you safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them. A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch. With new programs like "@CAPS2" and "@CAPS3" and "@CAPS4", it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well, is a great taol to keep in touch with family that are far away opposed to the good'ol letter which @MONTH1 take a web in the mail. Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to reaserch foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never even heard of. With computers, it makes it possible to go online, look up the @ORGANIZATION1, research it and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that he did not know previusly. It is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme saftey and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best rout home opposed not and consequently sitting intinse. With modern day technology all that is possible. They add great saftey and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusions, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future. I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics but it is up to you to set them straight! Computer save great tools for moving ahead and we should cheer, as them, not trash them.

Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society. But I belive they do. Computers help us learn information of al types. It's a good souce of entertainment. And last but not least, computers do not drasticly change the time we use exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Computer are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given. Google, yahoo, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. What would we do without them. They help us figure out small things like quick and easy way to get rid of a stomache ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you in the staff room drinking coffe. They also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze you know the tough stuff. These are the kinds or things you need to know and not everyone go out to the library everytime you have a question. The information on the computers is endless why not use it from learning a new language for next vacation to @LOCATION2 to finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment is everlasting on computers from the skatebording dog on. Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on youtube. There are @CAPS4 of games on the @ORGANIZATION1 alone from pacman to scrabble there's no way we'll have nothing to do. I always go on @ORGANIZATION2 to talk to family living too far to visit. Computers are one of the best soarces of entertainment, they definetly benefit society. Computers definetly do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature or interact with family and friends. On the computer there are videos that show us new yoga move and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the days. There are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted. And we always make time to go see our family and friends. Computers dont keep us hupnitized. Without a doubt computer benifit everyone's society. They re informational. The definetly entertain us all. And then don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people. Computer are one of the most helpful things we have and no one should think they arn't not after reading this essay.

Dr. @DR1, The effects computers have on people and why people dont agrees that this benefits society and some people us it to be online to talk to friend and family. Whey people dont agrees to use the computer. First the computer we could use at for every thing like go to other place you want to visit. Then @CAPS1 you want to work or go to another school some you need to do it by computer. Why not try to use the computer. I know computer is a lot of money but sometime @NUM1 good to have it. @CAPS1 people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For example some family and friends are not in the same place and they cant see each other the could write to each other online @CAPS1 they dont have cell phone of house phone. Then @CAPS1 people want to enjoy other nature that they dont know the could use the computer and look for the place. The three reson is that people could do exercising trough computer. It dont mather @CAPS1 the spend a lot of time in the computer being people could be doing a lot of thing in the computer. Like student we do a lot of projet in the computer we search for any can or thing. So people think that compute is fun for them. Finally other people that don't agrees they should try it. That the effects computers have on people and why people dont agrees and spend time online.

Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest.

Computers have a good effect on people because they can teach people hand eye coordinating events in history and about other cultures and they are a great way to relax and just have fun. Computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it. Hand eye coordination is very important. It can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly. If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain. He would be able to see it, grab it, and himself up quicker than before. Most people don't know things like how many soldiers were on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or how many countries there are in the world. The internet is a great place to find out about history world other things you wan't to know A lot of americans don't know @LOCATION2 history alone world history. You can google anything you want from when the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ended to when the @LOCATION1 collapsed in @DATE1. You can also learn either interesting and useful things like food recipes the contents in paints. Or you could just be keeping up with the need on yahoo.com. Computers are a lot of fun. You can talk with friends, listen to music, play games or do all three at the same time. That's just scratching the you miss your favorite show @TIME1? There are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free. Did you want to hear your favorite bands new album? You can listen to it legally and free on youtube.com playlist.com and many more websites. Between learning about other cultures and just having fun, the computer can be a great for interactive with friends and family improve hand eye coordination or learn something new.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers have many posative affects on society these days. I believe this because computers provide us with communication skills. They provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology. Read on to hear how i further explain my reasoning. First off, computers provide you with communication skills. I know that i am always finding the computer useful. It allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and dd friends. It is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone. Whether your at your house, or on the go with your laptop, you can talk to people all over the world. Secondly, computers supply you with information to write papers, newspaper articles, etc. When a teacher asks the class to with a paper about a specific topic, students can simply just go home on or type the topic in on a search . At that point they're automaticly supplied with thousands and thousands of different sources of information. I know that @PERCENT1 of the population of the @LOCATION1, prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information. Lastly, computers increase your skills when it comes to technology. Although some computers @MONTH1 be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers. They ar also always coming out with new software for your computer. By making computers and softwares more high tech, people the generation now is more technicly advanced than many other countries. As a whole computers have a huge impart on our countries technical skills. I believe computers have a posative affect on society. I think this because computers provide us with communication skills, they provide you with information, and they increase your skill whenit comes to technology. I hope i have made it so that we are looking at this from the same angle.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'@CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'@CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer. But if you can'@CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time.
<START>

Computers are progressing into our lives more and more. These machines help our world become an easier place to do. work, pay bills and even entertain ourselfs. @CAPS3, these things are weighed down by the negative effects like the online dangers, increasing  to reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new advances people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which udds more and more to obesity problem we face. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account, than go for a run or shoot some hopps. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on easy diet eat. and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack you computer, steal you personal info and destroy you computer. You can have huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber bullies are also a new and dangerous threat!. These people threaten and taught inosent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brain wash people, convince them to meet, and rape and kill them. Last but not least todays computers interaction with young minds increases ignorance with ads, and negleck of education and reading. Many kids even myself would rather be online than read a book or do homework. @CAPS3, computer can take over some people's likes, they will neglect school and other important things like homework or studing credting weaker minds for out future. Also, ads and website with false information can fall down our youth even more with ignorance and ignorant belifs. Finally, kids computer interaction can cause belites like "you shout vote for @PERSON1 because he is black" or other racist and ignorant statements. Computers help our advance in bettering the world and our understanding of our world, @CAPS3, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people yound and old, and their minds.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors."Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes everyday," @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason @CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. "People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy," ssays health expert @PERSON1," however @PERCENT1 of people don'@CAPS1 because of computers." this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which @MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still @MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, @CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'@CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. "Friends come and go and you and your family won'@CAPS1 live forever," says therapist @PERSON3", @CAPS2 motor the best of that you have." there won'@CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration.
<START>

I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.

Do you like going on the computer? Well after you read this I don't thing you would want to. I know that the population of @ORGANIZATION1 uses the computer. If your on the computer for @NUM1 hr. yo can damiges your eye and you would have to were glass and you don't want that soemtimes it's hart to stay off of them. The internet can be for alot for things like to talk to your friends and family. And to play games. the computer is for to about diferent things one thing you can learn is the presidents other thing is your family history. Now you know what the computer can do to you. Only use computer or @NUM2 or @NUM3 mins. That is what I would do.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology continues to become more and more enhanced so has the percentage of americans who use computers. @PERCENT1 of those americans, are children from the ages of @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use the computer to interact with friends on social sites or spend a good chunck of their home playing online games. But what about the other teens; the ones who are constantly facing cyber bullying or are put in dangers way by talking to people they don't even know? To prevent these issues, I say we put a limit on our use of technology. Social sites, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and facebook, have been growing at an alarming rate. More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset. I, myself, have an @CAPS2, facebook, and @CAPS3 and it's prevented me from getting exercise becaose it's almost like i'd rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog. It bothers me, it really does, but there is one question I always risk myself; how do I stop? I've been going on runs, studying more, and spending time with my family. There's ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology, we just don't know how to get the message spread. Other than the affects social sites and exercise has had because of computers, online gaming is also a big issue too. Many kids, not mostly boys, to what I see at school are absolutely loving online gaming. But the only people that actually benefits in life are the website owners. These games are not educational, it's not a good why to spend a couple of hours of your time. So generally it's a waste. More important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework. Just think, you could even hangout with friends doring that time rather than sharing on a monitor. Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer, bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats. If, you're someone who's bullied constantly at school, you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing; until bulling came along. Cyber bullying can lead to a child working themselves, getting fights at school or even worse, someone's like taken because they didn't think it was worth living. Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this. Computer usage has its ups and downs,but my point is safety, health, and education, one the main issues we face because of modern technology. I'd like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read. Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email.

I think the computer dire a postive effect on people all over the world. You can do lots of things on the computer like an acidemic work, talk on the enernet, or even find out facts' about fam'us people you love, people computer. I think computer can benfit socity becuse computers can help you with your acidimic work, and can also talk to you friends online. One way i can benfit from using the computer by, typing my school work. But when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famuse people like @PERSON1. I rember when is was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it becuse i used the computer. That should prove that computers are very help full. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life. If you said no i can tell you how. You can learn about diffrent places and food. Lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to. A professor from virgin new york tech school said that with out computers the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at new york tech school agreed but @PERCENT2 did not could you immagin a world with out computers. I if the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even t.v. Not ever on know the cell phones or computers lets face it with out computers the world would be lost like the proffser from new york tech said. Also teenagrs would be bored becuse most teenangers do not like to go out side and if we do not have computers how will adults do there work or they will have to handwrite it. Lets be honsest some adults and kids hand writing is like chicken scrach so to say. I think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing i think the hole world should keep computers becus with out computers the world is lost, to the past paper.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 opinion is getting out of mind. They're people who are getting addicted to to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, they're people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as @CAPS3. I know people who are addicted on @CAPS3 because, they get addicted to talking to people, and looking at other people. So they dont cooperate correctly with there school work (so they get bad grades) or they loose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed). Then thier only friend is the computer. Also other effects on the computer is if your addicted to a website (in generaal) you can get out of shape, because your not spending enough time excersing, there is already enough people in @LOCATION1 that is obesed and it is already a add on to the problem. I read online than in @LOCATION1 is obesed. So computers are a addiction waiting to happen. Therefore people need to start spending time friends and start excersing and stay away from the computer.
<START>

Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less excersize, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Must chose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer. less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the "real" world. This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without.

Do you really think computers have a positive affect? Don't you think way to many people are on their computer to long? You want me to write an to my local newspaper about what I think on the effects they give people. I think they have a horrible effect on people. @CAPS2 people are on the computer doing something it can give them headachs, eye sales but if they were outside they would be exerssing. One of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. Their are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to life facebook, myspace, formspring. another example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home first thing. She does is go on facebook, forming and youtube. My second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage. @CAPS2 your staring at a computer screen for so long you don't notice but your eyes are getting damage. @CAPS2 f was in sixth grade I needed glasses because I was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My first reason @CAPS1 I think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time. @CAPS2 your at home on the computer and it's sum out you should be outside with friends, family, or even just a talking a walk, and it's also a waste of time because @CAPS2 your on computer you could also be instead. You might think they have positive effect yes, but they damage your body. these are the reason @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer join a sports club. Now is the time to take action but making more clubs or activities to people. the issue is people was to much time on computer. these are my reasons @CAPS1 computers have terrible effect on people.

Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that "computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, "I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors." @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. "I was so releived to log on to the internet", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?

Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a mence to society. On the Computers are very helpfull. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something @CAPS2 would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and hand eye corridnation. Computers are also a good form of entertianment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpfull. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is evey somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer. On the computer there are many maps that give detialed discriptions on how to get places. Specialist say that over @PERCENT1 veiwers get to their destianation. The due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipies to make @CAPS2. That also can help make projects. For example They show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 pat. The computer can help you, learn langues. There is software that can teach people languages just like books execpt that they have animated teachers to help speak the languege that one got directions to go to. Reading all the didn't langues can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 americans have trouble reading. That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @CAPS2 gives a lot of practices. @CAPS2 also will improve hand eye corodination. When someone something they watch the screen not their hand. Also on microcoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye corrdination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are enteritaining. One the internet there are many fun games for all ages. Some games they could watch videos one youtube there are many funny videos there. As you can see computers are helpfull in many ways. They will give directionn to places or help people with reading, Computers are entertianing and fun.

Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers hace on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes ayou start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers beside thats what makes the money. Emailing, chating, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all echnology communication using these communcation is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends use a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I knoe it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer.

Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I dissagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers, they give access to the internet. The internet has innappriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The worst of all is that on the internet, there is always unclear indentification. Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually fourty years old. There is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes or obesity in america. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screeen so long you get eye-strain. There are also innapropriate pictures and writing on the internet. There is bomb making websites and illegal music downloading websites. Overell, computers are for researching but aren't reliable in safety and cause obesity nad family aruements.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a negative affect on people. Computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise. Also, children spend so much time on the computer, they don't get a chance to enjoy the outdoors. Another effect computers have on kids is that @CAPS6 stops them from spending time with family and friends. I don't know how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around. First, kids don't get enough exercise because the spend too much time on a computer. We know almost everybody has a computer even I do, but @CAPS6 doesn't mean @CAPS6 has to be used @NUM1. I am a athlete and I enjoy being on the computer, but I don't use @CAPS6 every second I can. Doctors always reccomend everyone to get a least an hour of exercise everyday. Most people don't do that. They would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot. That is also causing childhood obesity. If all you do is sit on the computer all day, your going to be someday. But people need to get off the computer and do something like a sport or even a game like. If you don't exercise you wont enjoy the outdoors. Second, people are not enjoying the outdoor. If somebody likes to play sports they shouldn't don't on @CAPS4 for three hours instead they invite a couple of friends to lay same basketball. Even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside. People @MONTH1 think during the winter there is nothing to do. Have a snowhall fight with some friends and enjoy your selves. Nobody should feel embarrassed even if you wanted to play tag with a friend but you're @NUM2. Just get outside and do something. There are millions of things to do that isn't going on a computer. You're a kid so long that you have to enjoy your selves now before your serious with you life. Lastly when you're not outside you're not enjoying yourself with your friends or family. People are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family. You're not hanging out with you friend if you are chatting on @CAPS4. Is @CAPS6 so hard to tell them online "@CAPS5 @NUM3 come @NUM3 my house." @CAPS6 takes two seconds. Then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend. I don't understand why is @CAPS6 some embarrassing to be with your family. Mydad and I like to go and play basketball or ping pong with each other. We don't care becaue we have fun. Find something your parents like to do and see if you like @CAPS6. @CAPS6 isn't hard to say to a friend or parent, "@CAPS5 to do something.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always thought of that question. Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. But what about us? Since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exersice, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside. I just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us. First, have you ever, notice that people get obiese so fast? I know the answer to that question. The obesitity in @LOCATION1 is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exersise are they doing there? People doesn't exersise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @CAPS3!! They are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer, " I htink that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier". I agree with her; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. Second, have you ever asked your self about @CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family? Well think of that. Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. For example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. I just think that spending time with your family is important. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happend with your son/daughter? In everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? Imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? I would. Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't lieve it alone. Imagen that you become one of them. You becoming obise, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. I hope you understand that technology is not everything in life.

Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting, its not really going to kill you. I'm not suggesting that people should stay on the computer all day. My last reason would be that nowadays everyone nos computers. Keep reading to find out about my three topics: @CAPS2 off way too many people are overreacting, I think so because people say "you are going to miss out or you are missing out on life. Also you are still interacting with your family and friends, just not verbally (only typing). I don't know why people are so against computers, its like global warming, so many warnings and noone listens, so why will they listen to people saying that staying on a computer too long can make you fat. That was just my opinion/thoughts on that topic. Next off I am going to tell you about how a computer can't really kill you. It can't kill you because it is only a computer for one and another reason is that you can get obeast and bored because I can't stay on the computer for more than an hour because it just gives me a headache. Well that was another opinion of mine so read on to see what else I got. Now I am going to tell you how everyone has computers. The thing is computers are not the only things that cause obeisity. Every one has a computer now because I guess everyone goes on facebook, even my mom has a facebook! But theres also other websites like sexual, games and friend sites. The most used website I think is facebook. I think so because sooo many peole have it. Well this concludes my essay and now you know my opinions on how some people overreact, how its not really going to kill you and last how everyone has a computer.

Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact computers help us out a lot. They help us in find @CAPS1, medical, research and to tell weather or not you have cancer. The computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day. @CAPS2 computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bopard. They use it a little too often. I anly play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. @CAPS2, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or intead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that @CAPS2, computers do have and effect on us but a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer offer for fun and research. It dosen't have an effect on me. It dosen't effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too. I also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be concerned with people using computers too much.

Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on wether computers are important. However, computers have revelotivizied they way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a moter, has a child! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him, what to feel him, and what medicine to give hime. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time. Then her other child comes provide, and she wants to find a health snork. She can feed him which she ca do online. Next she ways to make chicken fried rice,out she wnet know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web. Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier. Without computers our lives would be much harder. If we didnt have computers if the person who a report on @LOCATION1 would have failed, the sick child would have not, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would fail. coputers are an important afect of our lives.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know someone who lives faraway from you? Or have you ever used @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3? These are only a few of the techniches a computer has. Computers benefitted society greatly. It helps people @CAPS2 things such as allow people to talk to each other, goin skills from playing games, and it has images and it is easier. As I ,mentioned, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and the dialing it, or talking to than in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at @CAPS4. information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn @NUM2. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need guide-thinking to be able to win. This teaches nto be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you @MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to bag upgrades buy @LOCATION1 towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on @ORGANIZATION2. One thing that a computer makes easier.

Dear, @CAPS1 Who would'nt agree that more and more people are using computers. The isusse is @CAPS2 bad or good for you. My opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending. Too much time on computer. Also I agree with that because people are spending more time on computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend, And thats my opinion on why people spending to much time on computers. Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising. I say because i rember a time when my you to spend most of his time on computers and not for school eitner he would story on for all most the whole day he would bring food up stairys and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing. He would do this day after day. when I go over his house it would be dirty after all those times my my to hold him to clean up he didnt after he ate I ash edition want to got for a you can @PERSON1 the of and caliores he would say no I can walk on the computer, @CAPS3 one day he became really part and the doctor said you obeased but do you think he cared no but we would try to push him ever day to exercision know he has dibietes. We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computer is bad because you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get out scid. I rember a time when my friend would story in his house for day on a computer when I would ash him to come out sid he would say no all time, @CAPS3 one he to come out sid to get a new computer sofeware and when he opend door he got scared of the lite and run in side reason why spending to much time computers is bad for you this prove that get and play get active

Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that compueters are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probally see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing innapropriate things in it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 I belive that computers benifit society because it is a faster and easyer way to do thing such as. Communication, email helps comunicat with other people when you don't have time to talk on the phone at work or don't want to spend an hour on the phone. It is also faster than wating for them to anwer the phone and ther phone mite die. Or they wont answer and they need information fast. Another good thing about computers are looking up information like if you are going an atrip you can look up hotels find maps and plane tikets and see what the place will look like, or if you have a school project that you need to finish but you don't have time to read you go on the internet. If you have to look up a contry or a peresident or an animal or find picturs the internet has it all. Even bilding progects like plastering a wall bying a window or planting bilding a shed you can find direction and supplies you will need and the interent. Computer can even help someone at work like an arctech the can use computers to make a @NUM1 sketch of a bilding. Even for storing data like at the doctors ofice they keep you @CAPS1 in a computer. Or the goverment keeps secet @CAPS1 in computers. There ars still job like fixing computers bilding computers. This is why. I think computers are good for society becose without computers without computers same people want have a job and everything will be harder and be limited to sertan things like fast communication and work directions.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as the seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all. many doctors say that computers cause "the new depression." The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a facebook, myspace, or formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace.. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet. I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions to students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet. Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time. All and all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which cause people to have anxiouty problems. They cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. They create divertion that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely!

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 obese children spend @NUM3 or more hours a day on a computer? Computer @MONTH1 be fast and convient, but why of computer our country is one of the most obese countries in the world because of the "technology". Computers are bad for humans because they keep people from enjoying nature, keep people from spending quality time with their families, and they give people less time to excersice. First off, people can't enjoy nature. As you know, forest are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world. People need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it. Second, being on a computer makes you stay inside. People stay inside for at least 6-@NUM2 hours a day depending on your job or if you are in school. Lastly, @CAPS2, computers take away from time that should be spent with friends or family. First people will became anti-social. When being on computer for a long time, people will forget how to interact with others. With millions of people like that, our society will soon become choos. @CAPS2, some people do all of their they get obsessed and then their family @MONTH1 leave them. They will they fall into a depression. Last, computers are a waste of time, money and effort. This shows why computers are bad. Lastly, being on a computer gives you less time to exsecise and stay healthy. First of all, people will get fat. With less time to exersize, people can't burn the calories and will get obese. Then, without excersice, peoples' bobies will become more prone to diease and injury. Last but not least, people without healthcare won't be able to pay the medical bills and @MONTH1 become homeless. This is why computers are bad.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example @PERCENT2 of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. i remember when I read on facebook that the guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they tould him his son got hit by a car. Now, news lpaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you wan't your son going through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise. A study was shown and @PERCENT3 of people who use the internet don't exercise or work out. out of that @PERCENT3, @PERCENT4 are suffering from obeasity. my cousin is always on the computer and the doctor tould him to minimize how muchtime your on it because hes obeast. He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you want your kids to be abease. Lastly, now-a-days kids are "obsessed" with the computer an computer. @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer use the computer language in school. And out of that @PERCENT1 put internet on their phone so they can go on myspace, facebook, ect. Now, newpaper @CAPS1, what @CAPS2 happen if you wrote computer language in your article woudn't you get fired? In conclusion, i hope you took my letter into concideration. kids or adults will be unhealthy, kiods will be too obsessed with the computer and lastly they won't spendtime with family.

Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. Fore istance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way to much time watching t.v. It rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as t.v.'s, you say that your just going to be an for a minute and then next thing you know @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers @MONTH1 be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that the thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. People don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. As you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. It's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! Seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be.

To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers, @CAPS1 drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are throughh the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. Computers affect all of these areas of our lives. They teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. In a recent report the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages, "@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand-eye counts." says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. "@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings." @CAPS7 the coordination we aquire from the computer many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When saked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have e-pals. Computer have opened to communicate e-mail, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer there teens to e-mail trends or @CAPS8 as aposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, the phonelines for others and keeps phone bill low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finaly, computers can help students learn. In todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. We was greatful for the strain off his back. When asked @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole.

A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with eachother, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.
<START>

Dear local news paper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand eye coordination. Plus, some people like teachers, want to get staff off the internate for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, then you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology enhanced dictionaries help you with hand-eye coordination. Before the computer, people had lose success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or short handed notation like w/ or. Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences. They never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more hand-eye coordination, That was only the first three reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get alot of school work and get information about history and geography. like an online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when @PERSON1 was born. When the dinosaurs went extinct. Fun what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer. On search engines they have websites, pictures, movies, maps and more. That is why people use computer for research. Have you ever fell like you don't want to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to see your relative. Well I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of stuff to can fanicate to other people. The computer mostly uses e-mail. E-mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has @CAPS1. It is also like a letter. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer you can talk to them personaly. You don't even have to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand eye coordination. Also, the learn important facts about places and people. Plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are some and also a positive part of society.
<START>

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 you agree with what I'm trying to tell about people use the computer more than exsersise? Well first more and more people use computers but how does it benifit them. Secondly, they are spending to much time on their computer than exercising. Finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First more and more people use computers but how does that benifit them. Computers is just a adicting technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer @CAPS6 you with problems your having with your family...@CAPS11! Well I know this from ex perience. My mom is always on face book and I hate it I figure she loves the computer more then @CAPS7 do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by her time on the computer increase and @CAPS1 sitting there needing @CAPS6 on homework and i'm thinking @CAPS2 @CAPS3 YOU @CAPS4"@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS9. See i was just thiking that cause @CAPS3 I said that it's a rap for @CAPS7 but @CAPS1 just trying to say this computer went benifit anyone @CAPS11 way. Second I want to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper is that people are spending more time on the computer than exsercising. The obeast rate has been higer than it ever been. I believe by @PERCENT1! COME ON this is @CAPS14! people come home by @CAPS15.K and other fast food @NUM1 go on the computer and eat. Over time you get bigger and your apperence change. You began to look sloppy and nobody wants you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally you spend less and less time with you family. This causes you grow apart from your family your kids pick up bad habbits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells @CAPS7 that the computer is just @CAPS11 good at all. In conclusion I informed you on why I dislike computers. They @CAPS4'@CAPS5 benift you. Makes you lazy and keeps you from you kids. So do oyou the local @CAPS13 paper agree? 
<START>

Dear, local newspaper, Some people are starting to belive that the computers are effecting people @CAPS1 also on that side because some people would stay on it all day, get edictded to it and want do nuthing all day. First reason why computers are effecting people because some people would study on it all day some people when get homw from school or wry they go right on the computer. They would stay on from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night on the computer and do it nthe next day. Another reasons why computer are effecting people edictded to it because there off all those freind, plus when think on the computer things final reason computer people siting computer. So those are reasons are stay on some edictded do anything.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites. Also using computer helps you talk to people you know that maybe you haven't talk to in a while and you don't know their number. I think that having a computer makes you smart because i mean you still do other stuff besides be on the computer all day, when you are not on you are either hanging out with friends/family or you are eating or sleeping/working out or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of you healthy choices and you can lean a lot more than you really think you can. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing. I computer can be very health for you hands because when you are consteatly moving you hands gives them more strength and can give you stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. Inconclusion, I believe that computers are health for you don't take anytime away from exercising time or time with friends/family/sports/sleep/ or eating. Computers are a hundred percent health for you. So i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day.

Click, click, click, "@CAPS1!" @CAPS2 no, your computer froe, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, @CAPS3 you have a computer at home. You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like google, netrekker, @LOCATION1,etc. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself "the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanitory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as your safe. You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitly have a positive effect on people.

Do you have a computer? I'll bet @PERCENT2 of you do! You @MONTH1 spend @NUM1 hours on the computer or even @NUM2 hours! Computers in fact have many down-sides to them. You could be so invoilved that you never go outside or get excirsize. Also, sitting @NUM2 inchs from the computer screen does not help your eyes. Lastly, the internet has very inapropriot websites that kids should not be seeing. Are you a kid who spends @NUM4 to @NUM2 hours at a time on the computer? Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for soem fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer @CAPS1 or on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. It @MONTH1 be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but sooem kids take it way to far. They never go oitside and get any excirsize. this is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active. So, limit yourself time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad fro youe eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played @NUM2-7 inches from the over time, your eyes will be so use to sitting @NUM2 inches from what your recating, that when you back up you  erad at all. I knew this who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for long period of time a day. Today, unfortunately, the kid is blind if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @CAPS4 screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. if I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet @PERCENT1 of you would say, "anything." could there really be too much information? As a matter of fact, tehre is. You could be looking up a topic and something inapropriot, that has nothing to do with the topic comes up kids doin't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inapropriot sites. Its bad for kids, so stop it! After reading this essay, I hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. As a matter of fact it's physically, mentally and socially. So, next time your on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture!

Dear local newspaper, I'm writing because I've heard that some people think that computers are very useful and some people think their know good because people spend to much time on them, I think that there are good to have because, its ways to keep in touch with friends, to research the things your curious without going to the library having to look for the book you need. The computers are good to have because they can online that they dont have as a place to walk into or if they do its . I think it good to have computers because when your younger and no more friends you @MONTH1 have been really to them but you with them. You can email each other or search thru up online, to try to get in contact with them. Also if your family member is far away and you really cant talk on the phone of the money, then you can im them so you can talk without having to spend money. I also think its good to because if there's any problem with one to get to the library you can scan it up online. Also the computer is available all the time. The computer is good for doing homework you cant then always . I also think its good to have a computer if you need something but you cant afford it, usually if you go online you can find it and buy it save money, also some they have online aren't really an actual . I think that its good to have computers but not be on them all the time, they're very helpful, for friends, school and for .

Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, "many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers." They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say "hello" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate. Computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors. In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. "Hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticisniry." said @PERSON1 the chief othopedic sergeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. There are several portible computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a @CAPS3. Every since I was, ten years old I dreamed of going to @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of internet I was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if I was there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON2 created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they chosse to. I frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college. Through this program we can't socialize with as if she's at home and learn about her college experience.

Dear editor of local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen can be spent helping the community, exercising, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted because of computers, spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends, causes health concerns, and alternately @MONTH1 became addictive. First of all, computers @MONTH1 prevent you from spending time your family and friends. Often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so the seek comfort from the web. However, a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends. After all, nobody lasts forever and your time with once everyday. This precious time is taken away by computer technology, which will last longer than any human and doesn't even provide comfort when someone is down. For example, a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them. This does not benefit the and the bullying could lead to depression deceded with her family or friends, they could probably share a few and make everyone feel good, @CAPS2, time spent on the computer is less spent with family and perends. Secondly, computers can bad for your health, at a the eyes, and people with trouble seeing. typing a lot way the need for spending more time on the computer gives you learn time for examples and often temple you if someone finds a website they really like, they will quite went to visit it often, perhaps even multiple times a day! Along with websites, @CAPS3 games and networks are also very popular and addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems (as talled about before) and withdrawal symptons when you try to stop. It's very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start. In conclusion, computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things to be happening in individual's lives. There is less time to do things with your loved ones, more negative impacts on your a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology. However, all there, could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer.

Dear, @CAPS1 Computers do have positive effects but the negative effects are much worse than the positive effects. @CAPS2 bulling happens everyday. Not only that but when there is a computer around kids aren't going to be exercising. Those machines also damage the eyesight of humans @CAPS2 bulling is the worst effect of computers. This form of bulling has happened to many and we have lost many to it. @CAPS2 bulling happens to @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids. @CAPS2 bulling is a disease and it has to be stopped, kids have commited suicide because of it. Not only that but the life of kids have been threatened and taken by it. Without computers this disease would be stopped. Childhood obeasity is a big problem in @LOCATION1 and part of the reason is because of computers. Kids shouldn't be on the computer, they should be outside running around with their friends. Computers are an addiction that kids can't break. computers aren't just bad for kids, their bad for adults too. Computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long. Your sight is very important to living. Sight is, most of the time your most important sense. Now you see why computers don't benefit society. Online, people are harrased to the extreme. The bright computers screens are harmful to the delicate human eyes. Kids should be exercising outside not siting at home on the computer. Everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on.

Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things @CAPS1 could help you learn, chat with friends, and @CAPS1 can entertain you. A computer can get you sucessful in life @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults , and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way, @CAPS1 is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remeber dont get to close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I Have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get to close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes.

Dear People Computers are not a really good thing because @CAPS1 you think about it you never want to get off allways chating or social networking you can allways find something to do but you are wasting your time on the computer you can do anything you want but I think to much is a waste of time. @CAPS1 you have kids you would not spend time with them you can help your kids with there homework eat with them watch t.v spend time relax but some people like laydys with kids go online and never get off you have to have time with your kids so they dont have bad habbits so they dont stay out to late. You have to have time for your self clean the house cook food for your husband go out shopping take your kids out to the mall just enjoy your life computer gives nothing to us just gets us layzy. @CAPS1 you work you have to think about your work maybe hang out with your friends dont be on the computer for @NUM1 you can do other stuff call your friends over or go shoping do cleaning in your house computer does not give us anything its just waste of time @CAPS1 you social network.... There is good thing about computers you can find anything you need look at stuff talk to family from far away. @CAPS1 you use it in good ways its a good thing but @CAPS1 you never log off faccebook or other stuff its not good to stay on. You can just go to the beach or go to the gym you have lots of stuff to do other then going online and sitting for hours. Just try not to go online and just go out and go somewhere insted...

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living.

Dear @CAPS1, People are using too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time on the computer. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 seeing the @ORGANIZATION1 through their own eyes they are seeing it on videos or in @CAPS2 on the internet. It isn't natural for people to be internet fanatics. Earth is a beautiful planet, it has trees, mountain, seas, and humas. We creators the internet and people love it more man the rock they're standing on. The planet should be explored not surfed in the web. People should see the @ORGANIZATION1 before all natural hand is coverd by cities and factories. People use the internet way to much for plans, for business, for entertainment, for a social life! all @ORGANIZATION1 this has been done with ease before we could even on a light bulb. Life is a gift and people spend it on artifitial life. For example a game, @ORGANIZATION1 is one @ORGANIZATION1 the most popular addictive games ever made. In this game you make a character in a miderth planet while you battle m onster with other players. Some people think that game is funner than life (personaly I think it is) but is not their life. His just a fantasy for people to escape thier meaningless lives. I write this for suport that some day people will understand that this is life. So, live it.

Dear, local newpaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.

Dear local newspaper, Computers are fairly new, everone has one everone wants one! There are so many great things they can be used for. But are they getting used to much? As a student and a teenager I know I am using mine way more than I need to. Sure they are fun, and sure their very usefull but they are time consuming. You @MONTH1 be doing work or chatting with a friend, but your also just sitting their. Being on the computer taks away from lots of exercising or doing other activits. I am deffintly not saying to stop using your computer totally, becasue they are agreat inveshion. But why sit on a computer chatting to a friend that lives right down the street, when you could be outside, playing a game of kickball or something fun. It would be a good idea just to chat on line with the friends or family thay live far from you like in other states. Another time that I would say to use your computer is when doing some work, projects or homework. Or even if your job involves doing research. Computers are a great tool to use. But most people aboose that privilage and go one other websites that have nothing to do with there reserech. So if you need a computer for school or work stay on task! That way you get what you need done. If you are a student or have a job which is the comon day person it's hard not to use the computer. There are so many helpful things to use it for. But that doesn't mean you need to be on it all day and night. Take about @NUM1 minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see, do your reach. Then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more then an hour. I stronly agree with the experts people are spending way to much time on there cumputers. Use it to befit you, and to help you not to kemp you from getting bord. Don't abuse the fact you have enter-net if you need resherech get that done stay on task. Rember an hour a day is more than enough! So get off your computers go out side and stay fit!

Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers there days. Some people think computers are an improvements to society. Others are concerned that people spent too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. I think this because some people spend to much time on them,, it's one of the leading causes of obesity, and it interfers with people social lifes. According to recent studys, about @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers. Many ot these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as facebook and myspace. Others spend it shopping or learning. Some of the online games include world of warcraft, rune scope, and many @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games. Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or @MONTH1 became obese. According to @PERSON1, spending alot of time on computer is one of the main reasons for obesity. Many experts agree that computers are the learning cause of obesity. between @DATE1 and @DATE2 more people have been using their computers more often. The obesity rate has increased between then too. Most of the people who spend alot of time on the computer don't interact with their friend and family much. This can lead to ruined relationships, loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family. He also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide. Spending too much time on the computer is a bad thing would you want to spend too much time on the computer even ater hearing the cons of it? I believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone.

Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one and the number grows still. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintanence, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, "The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintanence costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are." @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, "@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psycologist, says, "The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are absorted and become normal. If a child becomes use to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustated and not be able to do what is needed." @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problmes, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world, they take our money, our health and the minds of our children.

Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because talk online, teach hand eye coordination, and other stuff too. One reason @CAPS9 he helps you with your hand eye coordination for example teach you how you look while typing. @CAPS3 we don’t learn hand eye coordination we won't know how to do other stuff that @CAPS9 hand eye coordination. The second reason @CAPS9 @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can use @CAPS1 for example when a family member @CAPS9 living in a different state you can see their face and talk to them like you do in person. The last reason @CAPS9 searching the web because @CAPS3 you want to get @CAPS4 ticits for a trip look online. @CAPS1's the best way to get them. researcher say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online @CAPS9 the best way because you can see when the @CAPS4 take off, when the next @CAPS4 also when to come back home. All in all I say that compuetrs are a good thing because they help with you hand eye coordination also. @CAPS3 you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking In person. The last thing @CAPS9 searching the web for @CAPS4 tickets @CAPS3 you want to go somewhere far a way go online and see when the @CAPS4 and comes back because researchers says that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 People say that getting online for @CAPS4 ticket @CAPS9 the best way to get them. Ask your self woild you like to have the web to seach or not?

I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes. I say this because computers can sometimes get addicting. The people who are addicted will only know about stuf on the internet. people need exersise. They will not get exursise by sitting in front of an computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted. When they get addicted they will probly fail in school because they do not do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel week and tierd? Well that is how the people who sit at computers all day feel like alot! @CAPS1 people whant to stay healthy then they should get some exersise daily insted of sitting in front of a computer all day. Alot of people get annoyed when they dont know about stuff when it happens. Most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers. I say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than. This is because firstly computers get addicting, secondly people need exersise @CAPS1 they want to be and stay healthy lastly @CAPS1 people like to know things the only way they will find out is on the computer

Dear Local Newspaper, I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to excercise. Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have varies websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about, are these websites benefitting anybody. Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distarction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would happend. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computer can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, vollyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers cannot have a bad impact on people.

Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore it's wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps. Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession, they will snap at you, yell, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get violent. If someone stays up to late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression @MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response, which @MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants. Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the neccessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutricious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin @CAPS3 throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obeie. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obeisce, @MONTH1 to anorexia. Neither or these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time. The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers. Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggresive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future.

@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and when you bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the causes is the internet. The internet is like a big book. It holds tons of great information. There's probly information on the internet that probly no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world. Without the internet. We would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't but in stores. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? then what will you do? you could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like collage people, Who don't have cars. So how the sapposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? eat? sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the celing? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and websites. It also helps you make new friends. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share you photographs online you can also advertise you company or buisness. @NUM3 out @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do. I think that the internet is great. You can learn all sorts of information you don't have to go to a library and you can play games when you get bored. Isn't the internet great?

Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans/ without even leaving your house. First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science/social studies assignment, I can research it on the computer. Also, @CAPS1 I have a just coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you money when you could text, chat voice for free? Also, many people use e-mail because its very easy and you can send documents to others. Lets say, that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to got it to my boss. No problem, I just it to an email and I don't have to drive. Finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. Its fast, easy and safe. Also, @CAPS1 you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. In conclusion, computers play a huge roll in the world because they can help with homework, its easy to communicate, and you can make /reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a posotive effect on people. I disagree on you part. I believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. Firstly, computers can ruind your life if. you stay on them for too long. Computers is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. The computer can let you look ups where your friends live, you can play tons of games ect. I remember this one time when I was watching channel @NUM1 news and a @NUM2 years kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. See, I told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer. Secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. The computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunatly the screen was screwed in too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literly have to stick your face on top of the screen. I remember one time when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1, my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood shot, the mont after that he got glasses. See, I told you stickig you face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes. In conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. The computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what I wrote in this persuasive letter.

@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a possitve affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes to chat, email, or to reasearch it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn @CAPS3. on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with carrent friends. also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on wether or not computers benefit our society.
<START>

Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselfs and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops. Secondly parents and childrens spend most of they time on websites to talk with their friends for example webcam and aim, this takes affect people because they can go on the phone or meet them up some place. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 like to go on different websites sum as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more this constart rumors and can end up in bad or goods situations this can be a horrified effection on these people that do this very often. Some people and mostly teens, and that can be caused it will always be a he say she say, this is why people should log off immediantly. Most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know, knowing this putting into negative situations @MONTH1 at them in harm.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far away too much time the computer. Please consider the following that computers have a negative effect on people. Furthermore, @PERCENT1 of parents agree with experts that @CAPS3 spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends. @CAPS11 I was little I rarely ever went on the computer. But now my parents have to consult me to leave the computer multiple times. Ever since teens have joined @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter, they are addicted to it and can't stop going on it to @CAPS6 what their friends are posting. Physcologist @PERSON2 states, "@CAPS3 who are on the internet for multiple hours a day, can't concentrate in school because their minds are on what they've going to @CAPS8 on @CAPS11 they get home." @CAPS4 up, @CAPS5, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, @CAPS8 to school, get home, @CAPS6 @CAPS7. This is the daily reutine of a teenager in the @DATE1. Secondly, going on the computer constantly can cause health problems. @NUM1 percent of teens who non-stop use the computer have to wear glasses or contacts, because of overusing the computer. @CAPS11 I use the computer without a break for multiple have I get a terrible headache because my eyes can't take any more of it. "@CAPS11 @CAPS3 stay up laye on the computer they are, have fatigue the next morning." @CAPS12 pediatrician @PERSON1 and middle schoolers are very much the most popular users of the interner, because they are mostly very tired and @CAPS11 at school. People who stay up very late have very black saggy lines under their eyr, so if you see a person like taht they are a overuser of the internet. Most @CAPS3 who are very pole also never get to @CAPS8 outside @CAPS11 using the internet all the time. Lastly children are missing out on the beauty of nature. @CAPS3 who don't get enough excersize, cant think clearly becasue tehre is no oxygen in their brains. Obesity is begginning to tape a toll on children who only sit inside and @CAPS5 junkfood. Children who rarely @CAPS8 outside and excersize become overweight or obese. @PERCENT2 of children instratford almost never @CAPS8 outside and excersize. As I was in elementary school, we had recess but now in middle school we never have it. The only chnace we have to @CAPS8 outside in the @DATE3 and in the @DATE2 @CAPS11 it's warm.

Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!

Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are a part of our advanced technology. They have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier, they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they keep people entertained in their spare time. Computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that's why I think people are so addicted to them, yet they do have positive affects. Computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people. If you really think about it, a lot of things that we use every day such as books, nice clothing, and music on the radio would not be here if it weren't for computers. We would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes. As for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music. If ancient egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @CAPS4. Our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly. Computers have positive affects in this way. Everyday after I finish my homework and I go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace. I do admit that I go on those websites, but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition, I go on websites that can help me understand what I'm not getting. Ninety percent of the time that I do that my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade. I have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre-school. Computers are helping schools teach students. Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. When I go on the computer, I might need to research something that I have interest in. Maybe I might want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or, if the universe ever stops. Maybe I don't want to watch @CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained. Computers will save me from bordom. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact it has a very positive effect of me. Yes, I might stay up countless hours, talking to my friends on facebook, but to me that's a part of being a kid. The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into. That is what the computer is for. Without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. Their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion.

Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to "@CAPS5 @CAPS6!" @CAPS7 you too can "lose weight in just one week"! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in "no time at all". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed "safe sides". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say "I wish I used my computer" or "I wish I spent more time". In the end, the choice is really up to you.

In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. Right now many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. One of the problems is that these people don'@CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @CAPS2.V. and go on the computer. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragaties in families and/or in that persons's life.

Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community.
<START>

Do you think computers benifit us? I think they do. There are many way computers do and don't benifit us are a lot more use full then the way they don't. Like kids in school use an online text books. Also a lot of company's have websites so we can see what there about before we choose them for the job. We also use computers to look up directions to places we want to go so we don't get lost. School kids benifit from computers a lot because they would have to carry home tons of books but instead they just go on the computer to get the online book instead of carrying home @NUM1 really heavy books. I know I like to go on the computer better then carrying really heavy books home. Also when you look for a home decorator you just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done. It helps out a lot becase than you don't have to figure of the hard way that the decorator is not good and end up spending a lot of money on a room you don't like. Also if you are looking for a job you can look up there website on the computer and avail them to see if you can get an interview rather then wasting your nature going there. I also use the computer to look up ways to get some where and it's a lot easier to do that then to start driving and get lost I know they have gps's now but they cost a lot more then some on a computer you can find out. I still think computers benifit us in many ways. Like using an online text book instead of carrying your huge textbooks home. Also using computers to look up websites or to search adresses, is a lot easier with computers. That is why I think computers benefit us.

Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.

@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept. So everyone I strongly encourage you to reconsider what could happen without computers.
<START>

Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and ofen found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers change all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide, or sea the web for some knew information. @PERCENT1 of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals. With all the @LOCATION1 technology out there. Nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. What people @NUM4 years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moments notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My @CAPS1 and my @CAPS2 have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies, or see how far away friends are. These are grown ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. Internet goes beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of @NUM2 non-function books, you could find in turn minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to. I see the point people make about needing excersize and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exersize routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature & @ORGANIZATION1 it. In seconds there will be thousands thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literaly hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin, or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the omputer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitly offered the course.

@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can talk" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, "talking" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!"

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better. For example. children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even sudlts have this problem. For instance, buisness people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information.

Dear, newspaper @CAPS1 I think computers have both a positive and a negative afect on people. On one hand you can learn about places without having to go there and get fact about what is in that contery such as food, goodes, and jobs. On the other hand the computer can also be a problum becous kids could spend to much time chating or playing on the computer and not enugh time going outside to play or going to sports practis but sometimes bad things happen from talking to people on the computer. Some people on the computer arn't always how thay say thay are. So if I hafe to choose a side on wether the computer is helpful or not I would hafe to go with not. The computer is not very helpful becous lot of bad things could happen from @NUM1 littul mistake on the computer like puting your name, adrres, or picktur on the computer.

Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. for example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these also as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways.

Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the @CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just "happen" to get lost, try going on @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up @LOCATION1 and in @NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future.

Typing and surfing the web @MONTH1 be exciting; however, is it worth the @CAPS1 risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and @MONTH1 have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb @CAPS1 individuals privacy. @CAPS1 kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder @ORGANIZATION1 to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids enter unproffesional websites and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 them have no parental vision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, @CAPS1 kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage @ORGANIZATION1 being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use @ORGANIZATION1 computer documents because @ORGANIZATION1 these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented obesity and lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1, said,"@CAPS1 computers users have lost their use if muscles, but they have gained to over @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fat causing a lot @ORGANIZATION1 hem to not be able to do activities they did before." I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that @CAPS1 say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? @CAPS1 things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products. You don't trust the internet because you have heard so much about someone'es identify or money taken away from them.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. "@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant." says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. "@CAPS3 a family is hard work," my mom tells me, "your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy." I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. "The internet is a broad place open to strangers," my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be.

Dear local news paper I think the computers benefits society. The three reason why so is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk onlone with other people, and computers help to make better technology. I belive that computers have positive effect on people. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the computers to do homework. I was visiting a prompt last week. I ddn't know alot abou @LOCATION1 so I whent on the computers and you know what i got to know more about @LOCATION1 and things to the computers I got a A+. So the computers have a positive effect on people. The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other poeple. Say if a man whant to a and he left his phone at home how will he take to his family why he had computers he can talk to his family online. My family is back in @LOCATION1 I haven't see them in four years so I whant to the stor and get a wedcan and i get to see my family afdter four years. So computers do have a positive effect on people. My last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology. Computers help people to make better car, light, an so on. Without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live. My father was dying without computer my father would die thang to computer I have father today. In the end computer have the benefits in society the three reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway place, and computers allow people to talk online with other people and computers help people to make better technology. Spending time enjoying nature is good computers have benfits society better. I hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people.

It would help us meet new people because we can e-mail them, and chat with them on programs. It will also help us see new places because we can goon the internet. And look up place see. It will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to people and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about. This will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. this is a good idea for all of us. We can all benifit from this because it's good thing for everyone to have. I think we should have computers because it would help us meet new people, seeing new places, and learn new things. This is a great thing for everyone. Not just some people. I hope you take this letter consideration. Because it will help everyone learned about new things.

I think computers are bad because people use them all the time to go on facebook and other wedsites that are sometimes wast of time. People should not go on the computer as much and explore outside and go for walks, explore the woods, exersise most people do not get alot of exersise that they need because there an the computers. People showed stop making computers so less people go on them and so people can exersise more and loss weight. If people stop making computers some people would stop going on bad wedsites. People should only go on the computer for reasurch for projects or for homework liketyping papers. Parentent and kids need to exersise to stay healthy because people do not wnat diebedes when they are young so it really important to exersise so bad things do not happen to your body people need to stay healthy and exersise. All the computer deos is mess up your brain so you do not exersise. So get off the computer exersise, explore outside, go on walks, and explore the wood you never know what you will find in the woods. Go see what you can find. There will be some interesting things you will find like different kinds of bugs and of insects. You might even find a lady bug. There is all diffrent kinds of bees and you might find one that looks like something. So go outside and explore you will never know what you will find. Go for walkts you will never know what you will find and different kinds of houses and the colors of the house the diffrent kinds of front doors, diffrent kinds of houses like small, meddiem, and large. Some house will have diffrent color. The diffrent kinds of animals like dogs and cats that are in the window or outside. You should go hangout outside. You should go hangout outside with family, friends or both and look at the diffrent stuff in nature. Made you can talk pictures and make a scrap book out of the pictures. Make go in the woods and wake around. Just get out and exersise and you would think to yoruself I should get out and exersise more afften instead of being on the computer because I am having more fun hanging out with friends and family and I am doing exersise at the same time instead of being on the computer. In plus the computer was getting boring.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's good for education mind exercise and communication all over the world. It could @CAPS2 be bad because it would keep you from getting exircise, being with your family and being healthy. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause. Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information. Sometimes these information are flase but if you find the websites you can get the rite information. With all of this information you ran exircise your mind to do better in life. You can @CAPS2 talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more inforamtion from them. If I were to say computers are bad for you I would I say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exircise. Computers @MONTH1 be the reason why ther are so many obese people in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 when computers are use too much people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that somethimes get you addicted to them. And staying for too long on the computer cause prolems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days. But even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People dont get enough exircise but with the help of computers they can @CAPS2 find times and ways to exircise so that they can stay healthy. They can @CAPS2 find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or worse. Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other. In conclusion I think that computers are more beneficial then harmfull because they give you alot of information for everything and you can comunicat with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use computer that won't harm you.

Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that @CAPS4 has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who arent safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble thean before. Spending more time, online in chat rooms causes people to meet preditors. Take my friend @PERSON5 she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was @NUM1 and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really @NUM2 and a pervert. @PERSON5 @CAPS1 the only on that this has happened to @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 say, "More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the @CAPS5 and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person." @CAPS1 the saying "@CAPS2 talk to strangers?" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At triputs, this girl @PERSON4 wasnt in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being our practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasnt prepared when @CAPS4 came, time to show what you had so she didnt make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, @PERSON1 says, "This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they cant do something but thats because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching @CAPS3 or online." @CAPS4's a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in alot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online "guy" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer @ORGANIZATION1 have been caught in sexting. @CAPS4's embarrasing, innappropriate and against the law yet @CAPS4 still happens. These people are not alone. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten in big trouble through the @CAPS5. Governer, @PERSON3 says, "@CAPS5 and phones are destroying this society. Theres too much real life drama already." @CAPS6't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on @CAPS4 all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. @CAPS4's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life.

Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, "@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already." I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, "@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer." I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I dont think computers are bad fo us or our health. I think they are important and needed.

Dear, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. I beleive that computers are good for the future. The world has made many chenges with there technology. I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad. If humans didn't have technology some of us wouldn't have heat or fresh water. We use computers in life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them. Or even people who can't talk use computers to talk for them. The @ORGANIZATION2 uses computers to save lives. Computers save lifes in so many ways its scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying. We use computers in hospitals if there weren't any computers the chances of finding a cure for something would take to long and the person could die. Lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say thats what they have. Two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late. We use computers to purify water. We use computers to keep us warm during winter. We even use computers in libraries why the library. Some people who have medical illnesses and can't talk have these little computers that can have something typed in them and it would say it. Most people use some kind of computer to talk, chat, and text. They might find it easier with a computer. The worlds a big place and many people don't know much about it. But if you go online you could find out stuff that you @MONTH1 never knew exsited of just plainly didn't know about it. Kids even use computers for school and school work. So many people rely on technology to get through there life. Computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer. Like me. Now so many things in the military, airforce, and @ORGANIZATION3 are computerized. The miltary uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most craziest weather. It could even locate a wounded soldier. There even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war. The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they could protect them. They now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down. This also alows them to see people hiding and they could tell the people on the ground to stay down or whatever. The @ORGANIZATION3 uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack. We use this to help with other advances in the future we could soon have a computer that could help out people in far places like were there is a higher poverty rate. Computers save lives, alows communication, and is a good way for research. Computers is what we use to live we need them to survive.

Some "experts" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the @CAPS2.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like @ORGANIZATION1 and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or @ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people.

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?

Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 though computers have many benefits, they also have many faults too. I believe that computers and the tecnology these days have many more negative features that positive. Some of those faults are it's bad for your eyes, don't spend as much time with family and excersising and the usage of going outside is less often used. Yeah, I get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight. If you haven't notested more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts, due to the use of staring at a screen @CAPS2 day. I know more than @NUM1 kids that have glasses now, I also know that over @NUM2 parents I know now have glasses for the same exact reason. Using these computers is great for looking up your homeowrk, but if you stay on it for over an hour or @NUM3 a day you'll probibly become addicted to it and eventually you'd loose your eyesight. The usual time a kid spends on their laptop a night is about @NUM3 or @NUM5 hours and the time they spend with their family is maby an hour if the parent are lucky. Personally, I feel tecnollogy is the reason parents and kids are less connected. @CAPS2 the kids go on the computer is go on @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 and talk to friends that they see eceryday, so I don't find their friend, mostly the girls but why not just talk to them in school since you see them for @NUM6 hours everyday. The use of technology is being abused! the computers were invented for knoledge not scandeious "webchats" or "@CAPS4 pages." The world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to original idea of tecnology. Now kids don't even take a faststep outside their bedroom afterschool, its pointless! Most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people. So thats taking the parents time away from their kids. Now that you have read what I had to say about tecnology now a days, wouldn't you agree that it just takes time away from your actual life? I think it does and hope that you agree with me.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that the computer is good for the society because, @CAPS2 and student's do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. @CAPS2 student's put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. @CAPS6 they need to look something for history class they have internet. High @CAPS3 @CAPS4 don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as there source. So @CAPS6 a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has became a big source of learning to our society don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families @CAPS7 not our friends came over. Go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Our families we are so little bit of time to ourselves computer won't hurt nobody. We don't on forever we friends or search something useful @CAPS5 we talked to our families @CAPS6 we go online searching for they couldn't fire. People countries to see @CAPS7 enough to visit for @CAPS7 they wanna that country they need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new fact's about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot. A computer is a great resource for the public. People wanna meet new people so they use a computer to do so student's want a great grade on those project so they wanna present it nicely. I believe agreeing with you be a very good choice.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you know @PERCENT1 of people today use the computer for necessary reasons? @CAPS5's true! @CAPS5's a fact the computer can help you with keeping in touch with friends, getting the latest news, and even gives you map access. Let me tell you some important facts about the computer. Of course, we all have friends in different cities and/or states! Instead of over charging a phone bill, many people keep in touch via email. Email is high tech, and super easY! All you need is your friends email adress and you can send them anything from a friendly hello, to @CAPS1 pictures of the family. Teens love to chat with friends and they're able to get to know each other better through the computer. Sites such as facebook are certainly popular with this generation of teens. The fun messages are what makes everything so great. Keep in mind all the avaiible ways to get in touch with friends and see why the computer is so great. Everytime I log onto the computer I'm able to see the latest news updates! I remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up. Thanks to the computer I got to read all about @CAPS5 and I was extremely glad I'd seen that because if I hadn't I wouldn't of got to see their last concert. While I do understand, the computer @MONTH1 not be the healthiest activity, @CAPS5 definaltly is a great news source and everyone reads the news whether @CAPS5 be political, or about celeberties. Knowledge about what's currently happening in our country, and exercise is equally as important therefore, I'd be the first to support the computer as a possitive effect on people today. Have you ever been lost? Maybe you didn't write down the correct directions, or couldn't remember. Next time bok up directions on the computer! @CAPS5's so helpful and could really save you a hastle. There're so many websites that have maps you can print out, such as map quest. @CAPS5's a much easier, clearer way to understand where exactly you need to go. In my opinion @CAPS5 can help so much and @CAPS5 would be the right idea to go cheer @CAPS5 out today. Imagine all the places you could go just by getting a map online! Keep this in mind as one of the many great things about the computer. Now that you know some posotives about the computer, remember how they could benefit you! Being able to chat with friends is one of the best! Don't forget about hearing the latest news, and finally, never get lost again, just print out a map. There's no doubt in my mind the computer has a very possative effect on every one! The time is now to get out there and pick up a computer for yourself!

Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are good for many things and are useful for anyhting. I believe this because every year new and exciting @CAPS1 and websites are created and make life easier. For example, "@CAPS2" is a way to communicate with friends and family. For me I have family out-of-state, and I am happy when I go on @CAPS2 and speak to them. Or I can also talk to friends after a long day of school. Another example is "youtube." On youtube They have how to videos that show you step-by-step instructions on anything, even on news and music entertrainment. Other @CAPS1 like word, help you set up writing essays and @CAPS4 stories. On powerpoint it lets you make slide show videos for school projects to presentations. Even excel let's you make graphs and any char t imaginable. And let's not forget @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 helps you when you need info on a person, place, or thing. And by useing @ORGANIZATION1 it helps you when you need information for other @CAPS1 like word and more. See, computers help everyday people wiht everyday life.

The question is does computers have a positive effect on society? Yes computers definetly have a positive effect on society. Computers teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers put a positive effect of people. First, Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time. A survey conducted by @PERSON3 shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have better hand-eye coordiantion that use computers them that don't. Proffessor @PERSON1 says "people that use a computer are much more coordinated than any othe person, it is a great discovery." You @MONTH1 be thinking that s computer would make you less coordianted BUT, computers really help hand-eye coordination in people. In conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better hand-eye coordinated you will be. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway @CAPS3 without paying a fortune in money to go the @CAPS3. I remember the time @CAPS4 my mom and dad was going to go to @CAPS1 to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount op money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 smome says "before I go anywhere I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climent, etc, on the @CAPS3. I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the @CAPS3 but, it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries. In conclusion, computer can help you save money and help you learn. Third, computers lets people talk to other people online. i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends. A survey done by @ORGANIZATION1. Shows that @PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites. aAmous social worker @PERSON2 says "@CAPS4 people use these websites it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities." I know you @MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous is at, viris software can prevent danger. In conclusion social abilities are up with computers. Lastly, computers teach people about faraway places, help social abilities and learn hand-eye coordination. Computers can help society and learning so help the growth technology today!!!

Dear Newspaper, The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technolgy device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and @CAPS1. They sseem harmless but its really just a place for harassment. Their said to keep friends in touch, butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids @MONTH1 say they don't spend to much time on their computers but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends, and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammer. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammer. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind.

Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fac when you talk with someone online @CAPS1 helps build relationship within that person. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer an teach when you type on keyboard your fingers inprove on reflectsel. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much @CAPS1 really is possitive to use @CAPS1. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different typs of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot. @CAPS1 is easy to belive a computer is not a good thing. But when someone looks at the facts A computer is a great thing to own. If critics acna take these facts into consideration a computer is a better object than what most people say.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bed thing for many resons. First i think it's good because it can help school work like to do a research and for other things that you might have to do for school. A secound reson on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web-cam. All their computers can be realy helpful they can also be bad for your health and family. I agree that it can give less time exercising, instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your and many other things then just bring on the comuter all day. It can also distroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time useing the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the camper. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper wher the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bed thing. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers we wouldnt have most of the things we now have in the world if it wasn't for computers. That's why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it. Those were the opinions i had on computers.
<START>

Computers they give you @CAPS1 and reasearch from a for distance from you. But is it good for you? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe they @MONTH1 be correct. I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances, it can also give hand - eye coordination, I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for reasearch or other needed actions. When useing a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places. This is good because some people have intrest in places around the world. Also, @CAPS2 need computers now adays, thier teachers give the write up typed assignments, or power point presentations. Also, parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how. Also, some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some @MONTH1 not know this hut typing is a skill, some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type. Also, some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook, I tunes, youtube, and twitter. Some become addictted so they never got off. Also, being on all of these websites and more try to give you things. that my give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop-ups to your monitor. I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or bok vacations. If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy. Computer have a positive effect on people. Just dont be addicted and got outside... and have exercise with friends and family too.

Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer bat their are so many reasons why computers affect alot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over wheight there are more than @NUM1 million children over wheight because of the computer . Like for me I use to love goin on the computer and I still do bat I see that the computer is dostroying my heatlh. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are alot of inapropreate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travle the world. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often. of talking to your friend all the time. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grand and. If they was getting bullyed over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurty them. I think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on I am going to think when I spend all mu time on the computer how it affect my life and my family, friends. I belive other people in the world should do the same thing.
<START>

Your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out. You relize it's time toget off and go outside. You spend about @PERCENT1 more or less on the computer each day, but @CAPS1 good reasons. You can multi task on it, you can talk to friends and family you haven't seen or talked to forever, and lastly, you can spend time outside as well as in side. @CAPS5 you were smart you would not listen to those experts Have you ever heard of the word multi tasking? It's were you can do more than on thing at a time, @CAPS1 example you car read and talk, or text and talk, or walk and be reading something. You have all these things you condo. Another example is when your on the computer you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. What you can even do is you can talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. What i mean when i say homework is when you have to type up an easy or something. The fourth and final examples is that about @PERCENT2 of us can multi task @CAPS2 of my friends told me that they just bought a laptop with a built in camera, @NUM1 now they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. "I haven't seen my sister since she moved to california @NUM2 years ago, so i thougnt I would use the @CAPS3 on my laptop to se her." @CAPS4 a mother of the @ORGANIZATION1. A computer or laptop can be good @CAPS1 talking to friends or family you haven't seen in a long time. Anouther from a student say's." @CAPS5 you were smart, and understanding you would now why everyones on the computer so much". When your on the computer and your friends start to talk to you about things you understand why, you ussaly don't see your friends unless its lunch" or before class. Computers help talking to friends move easier than writing letters or waiting @CAPS1 calss to get out. You get off the bus and you relize that it's pur sunshine out. You decide to do some or all of your homework now so you can go out and play. Your outside @CAPS1 about a few hours. When you come in its around @NUM2:00 pm. You eat dinner and ya just want to unwind from the days gigantic adventure so you go on the computer. Ypu can go on the computer around like wild animals outside too. Only responside kids plan their time acordingly In conclusion it is important that you now that computers are good @CAPS1 multi tasking, talking to friends and family you havent seen in along time, and that you can go outside as well a stay inside now is the time to call, @CAPS5 you were smart you wouldn't listen to these experts.

Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, "can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that @NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, lets people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers doesn't have a positive effect on people.

Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definately beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life?

Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article.

You must be insane! Computers are very important to society. My first reason is, computers can be used for research. Secondly, can be made. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. These are my three reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more send on. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wats to find the of products ? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! Is is that easy. Also what if you need to do reasearch on @ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and theres your information. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids/adults use the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order order all types of that needed to @LOCATION1. Or that a relative/friend can have a. How way simplier than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly you can talk and video chat. You own a other people, and you all in diffreent country need a a video meeting. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss alot? You can have a video family. this is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches them hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about people and places and allows for people to entertain themselves. As I said before computers are very useful for the advances of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very important in our current world because in order to play sports and type effectively you must have hand-eye coordination. When I was a boy of @NUM1 years I had survey low hand-eye coordination skills and my playing suffered because of it. Now after a couple yours of playing online my baseball, lacrosse and basketball skills have improved from playing online and practicing. Also my typing has gone up from @NUM2 words-per-minute. In @NUM3 words-per-minute. Allowing me to write reports faste and allow more time for revision. But the internet also allow me to search the web to make the aspect of my report go much faster... Though out people needed to suport their opinions and. Now the internet for a person to such to find facts relating to their topic. This bad of help can male school projects easier, make students be even smaller and give opportunity to help in need. As I got ready @NUM4 while my position paper this year. I realized I needed @NUM1 usually this would be difficult but with the help of computers, research can be made a whats let easier. Secondly, I learned so much while my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, like for example don't really pick the president. The votes they gave actually elect a spesculative to go to the @CAPS2 to. Finally, as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 I was able to donate through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website. These examples show how important the internal to learn about people and places, maybe give a helping hand. Finally, the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies. My mom is always telling me I should ways to myself without dragging her into playing catch with me the internet and computers allow me to play online gones by myself. Secondly, movies on computers can be a real time if you want to around. These are the reasons why I believe computers are important for improving eye-hand coordination, learning about different people and places, and the ability entertain you self. Though my opinion will only count to myself I hope you will to stress the importance of computers in your future articles.

Dear Newspaper, I believe comuputer have made a great effect on people in society. I believe this because they make you smarter, they help with entertainment needs, they also give you the option to socialize with websites, and online chatting. theese are things people need in every da life and heres now. One reason why I believe computers benefitt people in society, is with the simple fact that computers teach you things. I mean sure you can pick up a book, but why? with a computer you can quickly, and easily type in what you need to know and within seconeds you have @NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know. Computers can also show you places that you've always wanted to see and learn about, the computer can tell you an exact location and information about the area. I know your thinking to yourself. "wow how cool!!" but that nothing wait untill you hear what else i have to say! Computers can give you instructions on how to build stuff, step by step instruction to create a work of art. My seconed reason is computers can give you entertainment like playing games, watching movies, and tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important. My last reason why computers benefit society is with entertainment, you can make friends or chat with the ones you have, with websites like facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ect. Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression. If your always happy on the computer. Therefore you'll have nothing to be depressed about. Also if you have any questions at all that you have wondering in your @CAPS3 ask the computer and it will awnser your questions throughly, and leave you satisfied with an awnser. As you can see computers can do many great things, and what I said is only a few things computers are capible of just watch, computers will be apart of our lives more and more and if you can't use one you @MONTH1 have a hard time. please if you have a different opinion consider my decisons. Thank you for your time.

You say that computers are bad and does not help any one in these physical life but some people go on the computer to find yoga poses and diest tips and how does that not help them physicaly and mentaly. Computers they @MONTH1 get kid in a lot of trouble they chat on (@CAPS1, facebook twitter, etc...) but they also don't know whos behind the computers they spend so much time on that @CAPS1 thing. That they don't attention to life itself. Now there are good parts about the computer you can find things you need and you can check travel sites etc... so you can not say that the computer is all that bad it helps a lot of people. So you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life. And they do help people that have physical needs.

Computers are something everyone uses but there is a time when you get off and start expericing life. Computers do teach hand-eye cordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people. But it alos causes people to spend more time of the computer and less time exrcising enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Excercise is a big thing in peoples life. It people, in shape and healthy @PERCENT1 of obeseity is caused by of the computers. Staying on all day sitting down rating. I think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising. Most people dont know what it does to them but  time they get unhealthier and weaker. They dont know that sitting down for hars and hars eating a bag a chips does time. Once they start doing it, it because a habit and eating and just go on the computer for hars and hars. Not only does it decrease the time peole spend exercising it also decreases the time people spend enjoying and the Computers are addicting you go on for five minutes and you forget all what you do before you know it you have @CAPS1 hours. When people go on the computers they forget all about things they  do. Shopping going  with you friends and family. Enjoying nature  things and you that . It takes away your time that you can be going to the , going to stores restaurant the things you.

Dear, Newspaper I believe that the use of computer is so horrorable thing for the people of the world. I think this because they don't exercise enjoy the great outdoors and have good time with family and friends. When you are on the computer you are not exercising you body. This is a problem because @CAPS2 this "no exercising" thing does stop the life span could be greatly shorten. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 this doesn't stop more and more children will grow larger and not healthy. So the children care more about the internet the being healthy. @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 said "@PERCENT1 of children in school today are over @NUM1 pounds in grades @NUM2, when it should be only a average of @NUM3 pounds or less in grades @NUM2." @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the computer craze does not stop kids will continue not to go out side and get to have some fun. Smart parensts are wanting their children to have fun in the back yard. @CAPS2 children are inside and not out side they with not get vitimans from the sun. The experts at @ORGANIZATION1 said "@CAPS2 the children do not stop going on computers then they with never see the true beauty of the outdoors." @CAPS3 you can see nature is some thing children need. Interacting with friends and family is important for everyone. Because @CAPS2 one family member is having a health problem and has to go to the hospital no one is there to be with them because they never talk to each other. One year I found out the my great grandmother died of cancer. I had no idea that she had cancer. And I wish I was at the hospital with her. But wasn't because me and her never talked. Don't let that kind of thing happen to you talk and have fun with you friends and family. So @CAPS3 you can see that the use of computers is horrorable because you life can end sooner, your children get fat, and you drift apart from you friends and family. So don't let this happen to anyone else. Tell everyone.
<START>

What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kids/parents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. "I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe." @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family." @CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. @CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to @CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, "lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick. The issue grapple with is if you for or against internet acess! So get out there, and change now.

Are computers benefiting society? I believe that computers are actually not benifiting society. In this article I will explain how you will recieve less time exersising, less time with your family and friends, and less time enjoying nature just by being on you computers to much. If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can? Well, think of it this way. You spend so much time on the computer that you recieve little or no exercise! Everyone needs to recieve a little bit of exercise in order to fit and healthy. Our country's obesity level has gone up since our high-tech computers have come out. I believe that this is one main reasons of obesity. This is a major concern in our high-tech, computer society today. Besides you recieving less exercise, you will also recieve less time with your family and friends. I understand with your family could talk to them on facebook but you need interaction by talking face to face. This is one of our basic needs as an individual. Your family is going to be by your side no matter what. But you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you. This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them. The same thing goes for friends. This is another nacessity for basic needs!!!! Everyone should have some relationship. Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature. But @CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @NUM2. In conclusion, computers are not benifiting society. People recieve little or no exercise, interaction with friends of family, and a chance to enjoy nature. Everyone nedds to have these needs instead of fucusing all on the computer.

With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down. The technology of computers has benefitted today’s society and has helped people achieve great things. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today.

Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts in people staying on the computer to much. The reason why is family and friends are distant, mood swings can occur and also being overweight, finally computers can do a lot of things @CAPS1 far. To be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you. If you were to stay on a computer for a whole day, taht causes people to think otherwise of how you are. Also if you were to stay inside on a @DATE1 and your friends come over but you say, "I don't wanna go out", there just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen I stay up texting and talking and going outside and I hate to see on of my friend's on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friend's and family said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I didn't want to be his friend. When I was @NUM2 I use to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room. The reason being on why I stopped being his friend was he to get mad if I come over there to ask if he can come outside. Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired, @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything elese. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly online chatting room's or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also people think that computer's can do anything it really can't, everything a computer can do is like a drug it's addicting. Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is family and friends seem distant to you at times you get mood swing's and less exercising, lastly what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the danger's that can happen I suggest you rethink about computers.
<START>

Dear newspaper, I disagree with you about computers. I think that computers are helpful with projects, homework, or letters. For example you can use a computer to help you with projects, if you have a project to do and you don't feel like going to the library, you can use a compater to look up information on just about anything. And you don't have to draw pictures, that's what printers are for. Also when you have homework most kids or teenagers, even adults don't like doing homework, thats what a computer do for you can just look up the anser online and then your done in no time. Let's say you have to write a essay I know nobody likes to write essay's by hand you can type @CAPS1 and design @CAPS1 with your own designs and make @CAPS1 look nicer than you writing @CAPS1. Further more I know nobody likes to keep up with and if you lose @CAPS1 then you have to start over and that takes forever to do especially if @CAPS1's due the next day, you get bored and you don't feel like writing @CAPS1 over and you get mad because you already did @CAPS1. And when you had @CAPS1 in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and @CAPS1 makes you so angry. And then you have to worry about if someone store @CAPS1 and copied @CAPS1 and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they wouldn't lose major points and grade drops from a @CAPS2 to a @CAPS3 in no time flat. Lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters. You can write a that and people's report card's if your a teacher, and you can also write a letter to friend that mights have moved away. Therefore the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to yor wife or girlfriend at work or in school and @CAPS1 fast too instead of writing @CAPS1 and then you hards start to the worst kind of way. So instead you can write @CAPS1 fast and they get @CAPS1 fast if they have computer but if they work at a school then they can get because every school should have a computer so they'll be able to get @CAPS1. Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you haven't seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state so I hope now I have convinced you about why @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 to have a computer but as you sad @CAPS1 itsn't always @CAPS4 to be on the computer @NUM1 but once in a while @CAPS1 okay especially in an emergency if someone has just died in your family and you don't know how to get there use a gas, and if you don't have a gas go online and print out the directions so that you can get their and see which family member died and if you knew that so now that you know the importance of a computer. I hope you use @CAPS1 wisey.

Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This @MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the @ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. @PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. @PERSON1 told me, "@CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are.

Dear newspaper editor, In my opion computers have a positive effect on people. The @CAPS1 allows people to communicat. People can learn bout things, places, even their own family. I also think that with a appropiate dosage it could help your body. If the @CAPS1 was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world. Mr. editor what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacaition and can't have long distance calls, you can talk to them on @CAPS2 or something like that. If your not really into using the @CAPS1 for communication you could learn. With the @CAPS1 you could learn a lot. You can even go to school online, but as I was saying you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on fredrick douglas I used the @CAPS1 for help. I learned bout his family, his childhood, were he's from, and lots of other important facts. The @CAPS1 can be a good search enging but don't stay for to long your body needs you too. I think think the @CAPS1 better can your health. People always say if stay on the computer you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that. First being on a computer using the mouse is helping your hand-eye coordination. you can also look at diet plans, find medicine for your health, or find new ways to exercise your body. So thats why I think the @CAPS1 can help your body. All of these reason is why I think the @CAPS1 has good effects on people.
<START>

More and more people use computers in fact about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T has computers, everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world.

Dear the newspaper, Computers are great resources and are helpful in many ways. @CAPS1 we have the technology, why not use it? Computers give us simple yet very useful programs like @ORGANIZATION1 word or photoshop, outstanding abilities to look up any information you want, and keep in touch with far away relatives useing facebook or video chats like skype. Wouldn't it @CAPS1 you were just about to finish an essay for school when you mispelled a word and had to start all over?! Well this is what happened frequently when computers weren't around and you had to use a typewritter. Unlike typewriter, computers have programs such as michrosoft word, where @CAPS1 you make a simple mistake, all you have to do is press backspace. With programs like this, essays and flyers are extremly easy to make. There are also a lot of other programs like powerpoint, photoshop, or video-editing. These are real time. You can just put your camera chip into your computer and "walaa" instant editting. Programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and saves you a lot of time. Along with the programs to write a paper, you can use the internet and google to get the information! All you have to do is type in a shourt phrase and instantly get thousands of sites, all packed with information. And instead of spending ten minutes in a dictionary. com and find it in a split second. I took a tally and @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids use the internet at least once a day! Lets say you had a party coming up, but had nothing creative to cook for food. Just type in creative foods for a party" and you will easily have hundreds of newe recipies to choose from. The internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use. Antoher fantastic thing to use on a computer is social connections such as myspace, facebooks, or skype. This is a great way to catch up with old friends from highschool or college, or plan a big event while being relaxed at home. @CAPS1 you had soccer practice at night so you couldn't hang out with friends, but still had time to do a quick chat, this is perfect. Skype and other video chats are amazing. They are very convienent when you need to speak with someone all the way in @LOCATION1 for busieness and don't want to travel. All you have to to is open a link a "bamm" they're right there! These are great for buisnesses and long distance ralationships. I have an uncle and aunt who live in and we use skype to keep in touch. It a fantastic way to communicate acros the globe. Computers @MONTH1 make as "look"lazy, but give us a lot. Saved time from their convenence to run around and get exersize. Computers have amazing programs that help us in all ways, internet for quick information, and social connections to keep in touch with family, friends and buisnesses. Computers are one of the most convenent things we have and I strongly suggest you would agree with me.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to atleast get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an excerise day should be mode and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day @LOCATION2 or even more than @LOCATION2 can exercise on.
<START>

I use computer all the time and im healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise dosn’t mean your not healthy. I think computers help a lot in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no. It will even help you, if you have a job and don't no what time to goin for waste. Computers are also fun. You go to different and play any games. You can also talk to people on them. Or get email with is like getting real mail but from an computer. But there @MONTH1 be some issues, People are useing then to much. They need to get more exirses. So thats what I think of computers hopfuly people will get more exirse now.
<START>

Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people in the world use coumputers, we all know what computers are used for like surching the internet, games, work and school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in @NUM1 grade at mystic middle school. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps. This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pritty much forced to join gropes that do activitys like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pritty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous. Place because you can chat to people that you dont even know. You never know the people could be messed on in the head. And try to find @CAPS4 where you like and come. you so you always have to be carful who you talk to other wise you could get. Nothing eve really goes right with computers, there alway getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer. Also your computer doesn't have the right @CAPS3 it could get a vins and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Any thing could happen at any time with your computer, @CAPS4 of no where it could just die and not work and @CAPS2 of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explaines my part of computers people will think different. Would you want to end up like one of those people, that are in a camp because they are on the computer to much. Or you never know you could forever and never be found. I alread know @CAPS5 much it is for coomputers to get fixed, but you might have to find @CAPS4 the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more truble for peolple.
<START>

Do you honestly believe that Computers don't benefit society? Well, they do. Computers help re-connect with people. A fabolous search engine and watch videos. Computers are growing into the human lifesyle. Computers help you re-connect with people. My mom uses facebook and she found friends she hasn't seen since the early @NUM1's! It's a great tool to talk to your friends in your daily life. Also, you can video chat ur webcam to actually see them. Therefore computers benifit Society. computers also have the best search engines. Doing research for a paper on @LOCATION1? Google and @LOCATION2 is all you need. Basicly giving you all the material for an A. If your paper hasn't come yet, the internet has the times and more! The only place to get millions of songs free for oyur ipod or phone is on the computer. one of the greatest electronics invented. The amazing computers also allows you to watch videos on the interet. You wont to have a real good laugh? well youtube is where you should go To learn abat history, todays lifestyle and more. If you want you yuorself can uplood videos too! A great site, great computers, benifits society. After my essay I can honestly say computers benifit society. Computers help re-connect with people, has a fabulous search engine and watch videos. Computers are growing daily. Helping the user get the most satisfaction. They do help.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way. New advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively. It can contribute to obesity, turn you into a couch potato, and can take away from your social life. It's not that computers arent useful, it's that people are using them too frequently. As a country, @LOCATION1 has more obese people each decade. A good way to lessen the obese population, is to get them out of that comouter chair. @CAPS5 all you do is sit on a chair and play flash games and watch youtube videos all day, your sure to put on a few pounds, Those few pounds do accumulate. @CAPS6 fast food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 contribute to obesity, so do computers. When someone eats a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game, or go work out at the gym? Trust me, you arent going to burn any calories by clicking a mouse. People who often use the computer, rarely see the true beuty of nature. They are too busy shooting animated rabbits to go see real rabits. Would you rather take a walkin the park, or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beutiful place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you realize it. Being on the computer can even effect your social life. The more you socialize to people you don'@CAPS4 know on the computer, the less you know how to communicate to real people I know that I would want a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 be too into a @CAPS4.V. show that your watching on the computer, to even spend time with loved ones. Your family is much more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that (in my opinion) computers should be used a little less. Who wouldn'@CAPS4 want to be a fit, nature love, popular kid @CAPS5 people would just spend a little less time on the computer, and a little more time in reality, You could be a kid like that. (@CAPS6 I'm sure the @CAPS1 is an adult.)

Dear local newspaper, I think spending to much time on a computer is bad. One of my reasons are Exercising. People should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature. Also should be socializing with friend. Now my second reason is spending time with your fromily. Being with your family is important because their fun go out with. Also they're good to socialize with at home or any other place. Sometimes socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people because socialicing with friends and family is easier than sitting on a chair typing a bunch of works explaining about the convosation your having. And last my finall reason is being active. People should be active because it's fun and your socialicing with people and playing sports with or . It keeps you and healthy. Also being active can healthen your lungs and heart. For example football keeps your legs strong and built. And basketball keeps you quick and always running. It's good for you because being active gives you a healthier, stronger and in shape body. So their for I think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less but computers do benefit the society in many ways. Computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people. Besides the telephone, computers do have some bad things about them, too. Students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects. They help students create good presentations and students can use the internet for research. Having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future. Parents and kids can communicate long-distance friends and/or relatives and they can talk to co-workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own children/parents, too. Having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities, too. They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites, and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre-installed with the best up-to-date virus protection system, that helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inapropriate sites, and cyber-bullies. Having these will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep raising communication between people and be pre-uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber-bullies. Computers are needed, and without them, our lives would be extremely miserable.
<START>

Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, Technology is really a fascinating thing in life is it? Take a computer for example, they can check information online, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow people to communicate. This absolutely benefits society. Well, it makes life a lot easier and faster for people. Don't you agree? Do you ever forget what your homework was or what time does something start and end? Well you can always checks information online, @CAPS3 you ever forget! So there, you can be on task and get ready early. For example, you need to know what time a movie starts at the movie theatre so you check online! Also, you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework, so you check online! So whenever a student forgets, he can check online instead of coming tomorrow to school and saying, "@CAPS1 I didn't know what to do," or, "@CAPS1, I forgot how to do it." @CAPS2 you ever wanna travel to places but you knew nothing about the place? Or how much would it cost? Or have you ever wanted to learn about a famous person, for example, @PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something, you can just go online! There are millions and millions of websites about places and people. Therefore, it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place, person or thing. The computer can be really helpful and useful. Plus, you can plan vacation, to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online! So you won't have to worry that you wont have enough money when you got there. @CAPS2 you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes? In fact, you can communicate with multiple friends on the computer. For example, chat rooms can reach up to hundreds of people. Therefore, you won't have as much trouble trying to communicate to all your friends at a time on the computer than on the phone. Also, you communicate with people around the world. This includes your family members or relatives etc. @CAPS3 they live on the other side of the @LOCATION1. Plus, @CAPS3 you have not seen them for awhile or haven't talked to them, you can webcam or video chat with each other. Keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a good thing. The effects that computers have on people are really something you should thank god for. You can check information about something @CAPS3 you ever forget. You have the ability to learn about people and places easily and you can communicate with your family and friends!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you ever just wanna go out side and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well I know I @CAPS2. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kid are on the computer @NUM1 because they have nothing to @CAPS2 or it is addicting. The reson that I belive in this strongly true stament. That people are consurnet about how much time people spend on the computer and not with ther familys. One important fact about kid being on the comuter is how dangours it can be. Now a days kids don't relize how dangours being online can be for example I rember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meat up with some girl he meat on myspace but all he saw was a, balet hewdet, sex ofender. That told him he was the one talking to him online. That he wanted my cousin to go over his house and play x-box and my cousin screamed hell no and leaft to my house cause the movie theater wher closer to my house. Know being safe is important. Would you rater have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job. Only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason. Second of an dont you want to spend time with children before they go to college or some thing? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them to create a better with you and you chiled. Some thing you can @CAPS2 to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his/her favorite sports. So with the computer computer. without a bond with you and you chiled. So the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them?

There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said "the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever." @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said "video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society.

Daer People of the Newspaper I think that computers are good in some was like to look some think up adout the other side of the world. Like if you have to do a paper on the other side of the world a computer is up to date unlike a book so computer have a good effect on school kids and work so computer are good but other then that most people send all day talking to people on theme and don't go out side and get fresh air so computer have bad effects on some people and have good effects they all need for work and stoff so I think that most people use computer to much to talk to people and for gaming. But some people don't go on it for a long time and go out side and use a computer if they have to for work so the effects of computers is that to meny people use theme forever and talk to people and site and get fat from not going out side and playing and geting fresh aire so most people over use there computer on facebook and stof like that were they code go out side and site on a swing and txt and get fresh aire.

Technology is advancing every day. One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 know becoming reaching not only are computers are very helpful machines. Computers supply people with online education, hand eye and creativity, and computers are one of the main To begin, computers supplied large amount of people with On the computer you can anything In fact my cousin @PERSON2, earned his degree in accounting through college @PERSON2 now has a well having job in accounting. Without the computer people would not be where they are in life right now. Not to menchion just @DATE1 I was assigned to complete a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I had to do was do around an hours amount of research on @LOCATION2's coulture and history. I recieved on a on my paper. Computer are very helpfull in helping people Which brings me to my next point, computers teach The computer has @CAPS3 different and The computer integration @PERSON1 is a stafisticated, not only be creative in your way but gives you @CAPS3 hand eye @CAPS3 people are for the creativity and they from using a computer. @DATE1 Computers have and @CAPS4 have shown, @PERCENT1 of people say the number are way to communicate without contact with @CAPS5 the the computer is not such @CAPS2, supplying with boosts creativity and hand eye coordination and is also a main way of comunication. So @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers. Computers are helpful machines, more the mist are missing out on using a computer.

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high tech devises that allow us to connect with friends and family in other places like france or @LOCATION2, allow us to research new information, perhaps for a school project in school project in school and even play addicting games, Computers have moderized our life, and it's affect on human being is dispicable. We have taken these simple devices to far and haven't used them in moderation. Did you know that at least an hour @MONEY1 exercise is needed everyday? Well @CAPS3 from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because @MONEY1 computers. Parents hard earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers, they can pay anywhere from @NUM1! What a waist @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because @MONEY1 to much information on the internet, do you want that for your child. Computers were once helpful devices that have now turned in to @CAPS4 worping machines. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why are they abese you ask? @CAPS3 are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big. Kid's spend as much a @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, and not keeping active, @CAPS2 pull kid's in like a magnet. This obsessive @CAPS2 time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit. I remember one time when one @MONEY1 my friends, @PERSON1 got a new computerShe wouldn't come out and play basketball with us anymore she just stayed inside. Eventually saly became obese and got diabetes. Parents is this what you want for your @CAPS3? Do you want to pay for a machine that makes your @CAPS3 extremley whealthy? Times are tough, money is tight and electronics are expensive. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 TO EVEN @MONEY3 that is a ton @MONEY1 money. Parents work hard hours, for exampe @NUM3 that is a long day and probably dont make enough money to be waisting it on a @CAPS2. An average houshold spends @MONEY2 on computers in a lifetime. Do you really want to be buying your @CAPS3 a machine that costs an outragous amount @MONEY1 money that will only make your @CAPS3 unhealthy and pull them away from their sports? I remember when my mom bught me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dolllars and the next day it broke. What a waist @MONEY1 money. Help your @CAPS3, don't buy a @NUM2,000 dollar @CAPS2, keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy. Make sure your green stays in your wallet. Hey, a small window pops up you screen. Who are you, you respond in an voice, @CAPS7, your freind @CAPS8's friend says the little window. You respond with an @CAPS7 hi, hey you want to come over, it's the cook thing, @CAPS9 ok you respond. What's wrong with this situation? Well a lot @MONEY1 things are but this happens to @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 online chatters. Just remember online you can be whoever you wont to be you could be only ten, but say your @NUM6. So many @CAPS3 are kidnapped because @MONEY1 online chatting. You can talk to your @CAPS3 all. you want but it doesn't mean thy won't be in that situation. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2 the less chance will have @MONEY1 being kidnapped, The @CAPS2 is so dangerous, would you ever put your child in danger. Computers used to be helpful devices full @MONEY1 information, enjoyment and talks with aunt's uncles, and even your friend @PERSON2. Now these computers have transformed into pursuading boxes full @MONEY1 hamful side affects. Do you want your child feeling the wind in their ears the sound @MONEY1 their heart pumping vigurously and the smell @MONEY1 grass on do you want them to experience the bright screen in their eyes and the thrill @MONEY1 just beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions? and lastly do you want your @CAPS3 put in danger by simply just using a @CAPS2 at home. Computers are @CAPS4 morphing devices that take away @CAPS3's points in life. Do you want thet for them.

@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why the computer technoligy benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and helps people connect with family. By readin this letter, I hope that this make computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says,  I dont know where our business would be if we didn't use computers. " @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Finally, computers help families that are seperated, connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people. A system that could regulate peoples computer use could be implamented but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made but, if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it?"

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow you self to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes a day at the most that will allow you plenty of time to go outside & excersize. Useing the @CAPS5 is fine in moderation, but if you are constantly on the @CAPS5 it can't be healthy @CAPS2 You (unless its your job) you should only be on the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day! So me people are on the @CAPS5 so much that they re eyes get worse & worse, Not only does it affect your physical health but it take hurts your physical @CAPS3 are some stories of blood shut eye, pink eye, or even @CAPS4 this is a very serious issue the people who are like this are called @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 over @PERCENT1 of people say they know or are someone who is a @CAPS5 addict, and scientists say in the next year that number will double or even triple. I know that people need to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 things such as email, projects, Ideas, or even models but really does anybody read a book anymore! 
<START>

Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I believe that kids and adults spend more than enough the on their computers I can see how it benefits you in some ways but it keeps you away from halwe, being outdoors and excersizing. It also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life. People go on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines and a little more than half those site's results are fuke. And the more people go on computers, the easier it is to yet caught pladurizing and that is a big thing in the community. Those are some ideas, but I have some more don't worry and details to go along with those ideas. People need fresh air, excersize for their body and to enjoy the outdoors. You can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer. And instead of searching the places online and what their all about, just go visit them. You will get fresh air, excersize and experience. And after having that experience you will pass it on, teh real to ohter people will not get any of hot fake stuff. For example, you can search @CAPS2 online and they just have pictures food. But if you take visit there you will get to really last the food. Would you rather being sitting in a chair, staring at the computer, or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before? You will never get or learn anything by pudurizing plus you will get than and get clicked. But if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool, then you will learn and. That is also because kids are too lazy to it out because they are not outside doing things and they're inside and used to they becausethey are so their computer all the time. I guest I also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places don't give you. Like, you also need skills, mainley, hand-eye coordination for typing the long papers for collage and those skills will get you for in life. It's like a chain reaction, you type on the computer a lot, you will have good hand-eye coordination if you have good hand-eye coordination, you will do good in school, and it goes on. And you end up being successful. Another benefit with computers is the sales, more and more people are buying computers which helps the economy so I guess I agree but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers. So wether you have a computer or not, if you dont I prefer not to get one, but get off your bum and do some excersizing and visit those topical islands you always visit.

Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think it’s a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.

Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @CAPS3. My @CAPS4 oppinon is that same say people use their computers so much they don’t yet exercise. When that is not true do to the fact that computers have. Programms on how to watch your weight. Stocks and etc also Technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. on the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their rezemates to jobs on why and how their based. On showing people their recent jobs. And giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @CAPS6 save. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, dealships, all over the world industry. Why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 on field to use for @CAPS7 sean, pregnacy, pulse radar's and more. And on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truht is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and. the @CAPS8 is that people should agree. that computers help people, speak, @CAPS9, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @CAPS9 tel your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology. Is a good way nto control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way I make sites audio and interesting Technology can allows people on ways to help people. Find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip. These days, and to the people who have read this article should pass this story on to people who take technology on negative terms and to help them think about it positive.

Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is the good to use when researching has fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant reletives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hours it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you oppinion on this great invention, the computer.

Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 people think that computers are good for socity but I do not. Computer's riskes out weighs the benighits. My first example is my father. My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on. For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was. So you can see why my family does not like computers. My family is always at the farm or in the barn working on we have no time to be on the internet the only thing you need it for is school work. What ever happened to the old fasion way no computer, no problems.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons why computers effects have on people. First, computers are not good for your eyes. Second, the reason why people get on computers a lot. Third, there are so much games and places to go like myspace, facebook and even twitter and much more. Keep on reading so I could tell you all about my three reasons. First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are like @CAPS3's is the something but not really because computer as more information and @CAPS3 dont really got so much information you could browse for. My second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more. Third, some people dont even dare if they be on ocmputer they wont they might think that just becaus ethey wear gasses they wont get blinder but they are wrong they will get more blinder. As you reading you will find out my second reason fro being to much in the computer. My second reason, is that why people get in computers alot well peopel get on computers just to their or do their taxes but that is not good because just because your doing your bills or your taxes you  to alot of information that people in other countries or state could get without you knowing , second is that people or get on computers to pay their bills or do their taxes they also get on the computer to maybe order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go like a vacation place or a business trip. my third reason is that they not only buy or order things but thet get in websites that will make their lives better like meeting soembody special or something else. As you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers. My third reason, is that their are alot of activities to do in the computer for a example myspace, facebook and twitter are the most popular website that people get in just to meet new people and talk to old friends. In conclusion, people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people.

In our socity computers have a big role. Some people think that this inhaces our socity and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people think computers are hurting the @CAPS1 citizens. I belive that computers can have our socity into the next and can inhance use to people. Comptores can benifit people by tracking hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn about the world, and allow people to communicate to others. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination which helps people work with their hands. An arument on the of this is that computers take the place of exercise. For a lot of @CAPS2 a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need hand-eye coordination. Computers don't take the place of they inhance the persons ability to play for exsample to be a goaly in any sport you need fast mentions and good hand-eye coordination. A computer can help the save more goals by increasing their hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination can also save you life. If a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands. This would you, if you had hand-eye coordination you away with your body to avoid the knife. Computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well. Computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. Computers can teach go about culture and life that you didn't even know excisted. The cahan @CAPS1 can not aford the luexury of seeing the world first hand, computers let those people see the world from difient points of veiw. If a student needed to know all about one country they could go on the enternet and get a tour. A student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer. They can the wanted with one click. Family, friend and coligees are all people you need to talk to. Computers made communication easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in video chat. This benifits socity because if you are talking to a buissness partner you can point to graphs and charts you made. You can also to see a love one that you miss. Their is a different type of comunication for every person. You can e-mail, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Comunication connects people around the world it a small world after all. Computers have taken our socity in the next level. People can travel the world in a second, talk to anyone and have hand-eye coordination. Computers are growing @LOCATION2 keeping is on top. What would you choose?
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. Since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese. They don't get enough exercise. That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you. You might end up being lonely. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. I don't think people realize it, but it can. I can take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek help, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to inform you that I agree with the followings said on the writing prompt. First, I will be talking about how people  use computer too much. Secondly, I would talk about people who talk online way too much. Lstly, I would say spending to much time on their computers. To start, people that use computers too much. First, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. Also, peopel talk online way too much. First, they go to face book all the time. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address. Certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst. Secondly, might be argueing with a friend. Lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites. So @CAPS1 did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun. In conclusion, this was why I agreed with beign active because being on the computer all day would get your and hard use too being on the computer @NUM1.

Computers should be for everyone! Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you. Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning. Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online with other people. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do. For example fly a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer.This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around. it benefits society, and I enjoy every bit of using it. Thank you.

Dear Newspaper, People always believe that technology today such as computers are making more and more people lazy and not going out into the real world such as people who don't spend time with family, become very unfit, and also @CAPS1 websites and people you talk to can put you in harms way and you can get hurt. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them, @CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but @PERSON1 said "@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are becoming @CAPS2 because of computers intead of going for a walk or nice day they sit in their room and sit on the computer and seeing virtual things instead of seeing things. @CAPS1 prove who are sitting on the computer people you might should be joining a sports learns with everyday. Last, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 that go on the computer and adults are getting because of the of talking to people you have never seen or really know about. When you are on and someone and live where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that. I hope that if you or a family is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, i do not believe that computers benefit society, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end.

Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far to much time on computers. This go for children and adults alike. Just think about it anything you can do on a computer you can do without a computer. That and pepole need to spend mor time outside expiriencing nature. Lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. Think about it you can reserch and find pictures from books and magasigns. Insted of social networking sites you can actualy go and see the person or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live. Face it you can't do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors. On a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing it's just a snapshot of it. Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass, you can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other cretures surounding you. Going outside is better for you to. Outside you get exersize and vitimin @CAPS2 while inside you get fat lazy and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inapropriat pictures and talk about inapropriat topics. They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs. Children allso often use the internet irrisponsibly and to things that can dissrupt frendships and get them into truble. The computer has also made it alot easyer for kidnappers to find children and kidnapp them. They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not realy benificial to our socity. They have no rel use that isn't alredy taken care of. The can not replace the real outdoors. Lastly they can be eisily used for bad even ilegal purpuses. As you can see computers should be used as much as they are being used by the general public.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a society we have come very for regarding advancements and inventions. One invention has made a large impact in the world and still ceases to amaze… it's the computer. This piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it, everyone would be stupefied. For exomple, this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network. In addition, specially designed computers can tend to peoples specific needs. Furthermore, they allow you to expand your knowledge. Therefore computers have positive effects. Just think of all the people you've emailed or instant messaged in the past week... Your dad, while he was on his busness trip, your aunt and uncle who e-mailed you pictures of their new born baby, your friends from camp... The list can go on and on. Computers like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 provide social networking like @CAPS4, i-chat, video chat and more so you can keep in touch with your family and friends. For example, in my life I use my @CAPS5 to video chat with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at college in @LOCATION1. It's our way of keeping in touch instead of not seeing her for months on end or having to pay for plane tickets every weekend to go down and see her. With the computer keeping in touch with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is a piece of cake. However, computers also provide surfaces for those with medical needs. If someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency, computers will be used to monitor that person. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are on essential in their facilities. For example, when my grandfather, @PERSON2 was being cared for at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to make sure his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure were all in check. And, if something was wrong. the computer would alert the doctors. Therefore, computers are also a huge help in the medical department @CAPS1 well. Lastly, computers can expand one's knowledge. There are thousands upon thousands of websites; all of which can teach people different things. For example if you are going on a trip to @LOCATION2 and wish to learn about their culture before you leave, you can just type it into your internet browser on your computer and bam! You're fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer. Also, in my life, my teachers assign @CAPS1 research papers requiring us to find information on a topic. Perhaps going the library isn't an option, how are you going to acquire the information? The answer is simple, go on the internent! Internent research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research. I was recently assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher, @PERSON1 where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it. Every student in my class used the computer in some way, shape, or form for their project. Thus, computers can allow you to get information efficiently. In conclusion, computers provide an abundances of uses. Primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family, help in the medical field, and expansion of knowledge. Henceforth, I believe that computers serve @CAPS1 a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people are rather great.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people? I think it has a Positive affect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, You can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, Computers are used for education around the world. For example some people use it to go to college online. Others use it to find information on things like egypt, where we cant go. Second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friend. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend. Lastly, You can use computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in haiti. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive affect on us. I hope you agree with me.

Dear, @PERSON1 I think that computers are good for people it helps them find where their for like a good to people and also with '@CAPS1' to show a computer @CAPS2 you go to look for a jobs you have experence with computers to get a good paying job to be fliping biggers @CAPS2 you got older I know I had I got older I whow to be a starter in life I want to get normal life even than no is normal also the computer is goodis look for like even tell you how it has a five star a @NUM1 star you dont want to go to. You rather go to a fire that is whyt a computer is so much more better a computer tells you I have hand good @NUM2 for if your is making fingers if pots of people use computers my teachers use computers every day on a regular they look send them into the computers and give them names. What I am doing the cmr's I of my teachers is this computer That is what I think which computers are good for people.

Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better!

The people who are concerned about the bad on computers are right about a couple things, but good does come out of it like what is the miltary needs recruits for the army they can post up their ad on the computers that everyone will see, and what the people who drop out of school and they want a second chance they can appily for scholl online. My last reason is what those people who have a hard finding work they always look up the best job for them over the internet. Read More to find out how the internet is good for society. First, as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people they can post their ad up over the internet. Sure they can mail it out but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it. For example, they can post the ad up on myspace and have thousands of people looking at it in minutes. Finally, the internet is a great way for the miltary to recuit soldiers. Next,

There are many great things about computers. If we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. You can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @CAPS3 on limits. Last it can save lives Computers are great, if we were to loose them. There would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @CAPS1 or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technacly be going back @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away You can also get one of those @CAPS2 fits for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos. Next, it should be up to the @CAPS3. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. Stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives, @CAPS3 can give limits and computers can used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer

Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally I think not going on the computer benefits you, @CAPS1's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, lets say you went on the computer for an hour, that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calleries! Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise, are in risk for health problems including obesity. As you can cleary see going on the computer really isnt the healthyiest choice to go. Most definatly going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer. A girl named @PERSON1, from @LOCATION1 "I love to enjoy the beuty of the outdoors that god gave to me I wish I knew that years ago while I was a lazy woman on the. If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy @CAPS1! Everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest! in order to do that you have to see life and go out there and experance @CAPS1, not sit on a computer! Without a doubt this world is gorgeous and @CAPS1 is worth while to see the nature! Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family! One day on a @DATE1 night @PERSON2 was on the computer and her mother called saying, "@PERSON2 @CAPS1's time for dinner", @PERSON2 ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! Now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone shown more time for each family member, not the computer! Its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! With no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly @CAPS1 will not only benefit you but @CAPS1 will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some qulity time with your family!

Does computers have an effect on people? Do they have a good effect or bad effect. Dear Local Newspaper, I agree they have a good effect on people because you can learn from them, you can can look at maps if your leaving out the state there good to talk to people online, you can shop online. I don'@CAPS1 think adults spend too much time on computers than exercising I think kids mostly on the computer playing games and other activities, some people use computers for homework, writing papers, or searching for people. Computers are good ways to learn about people and words, there not just for playing games and listening to music, there for good use, you can look up restaurants and look at there prices, @LOCATION1 shows site you can look at episodes of @CAPS1.V. shows online. I think computers are better than books and dictionary because you can do all that stuff on a computer. Some people think computers are good things to have cause its fast and easy. Some people thnk computers are a waste of time on them. Computers are good because if you need to write a paper you can type it and print it instead of having messy hand writing, computers are good for if your in a rush to search something its fast. Computers are useful for anything like books, writing paper, websites, chatting with friends web maps, music, games and etc, they do have a good effect on people and kids.

Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising,. I think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. How can you never things do. My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. For example over vacation I did things and things about my family and friends than I never know why because I people interacting I learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. Have fun where is the computer. Please don't your life live your life. It's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn at home, connect with other people, and give a source of entertainment. From these reasons our lives because easy and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accesible to the public. To further help the public, there are ways to gain college degrees online. that how . Even if you go to school a computer @CAPS1 still help you excel in you work @CAPS2 sources of research are available on the computer and you like to the web a computer is a great place for fun. However, people still think computers are good. They claim to gaining on the other hand, the computer gives people website to help lose weight.They also say people aren't enjoying nature, even though there are @CAPS2 ways to appreciate on the computer. Lastly, it is stated that you dont . To conclude, computers greatly benefit us and are good. New technology is good thing and should keep expanding because of gaining the ability to , conncet with people and having fun, a computer helps the general public.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 the ages, technology has constantly been evolving and improving the way we think. From the first simple telephone in the @DATE1's to today's touch-screen iphone. From riding horses to riding extraordinary fast sports cars and hwlet trains. The advances in technology have proven the sky have the limit the invention of planes. We have even reached the moon and left our ! Computers have only become faster and. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, believe it doesnt benefit socialy. I veherrertly believe that computers benefit. They have the ability in and teach us what seems like information, second, they have made the could a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constanly helping society. They follow what technology to make life @CAPS3. First of all, computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to and teach teach us what seems like infinite information. Today, when soneone know/wants to some first place they usually that's light the. This is because engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have of limits to with much information on the topic being. This has not only made leaving @CAPS3, but has also helped in studying for tests for elementary school. Computers also of for the average. From banking to powerpoint computer with all! For this reason even older such as @PERSON1 find computers weird. Second, computers benefit society becuase they the world smaller through communicates. Sixty years ago, it could relative on the. Today, you can easily video a rective in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less that ten seconds. Not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile what children can even such as @CAPS4. When there is a they can still talk to warry of. Finally, computers benefit society have the ability to locate missing people. The record earthquale in @LOCATION3. cries of mothers children whom they from. It is to computers that these families were scuniled. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name disaster should over happen. Not only this you family. All they had to do me! Computers have even made our society. What move could. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers society is because computers contain much informations and programs they have proven the earth is a "small world after all" and they have made the world safer. It is that many people are buying computers, so why don't you get one?

Dear Newspaper, i am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them & less time excirsing, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people & think "they don't have to know what I look like."They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say "sure! Now they say "@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk." That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each otehr & it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things, they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't excirse they don't enjoy nature & computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view & make their own decisions.

Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we

People using computers is a good way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn keyboarding skills, and research about far-away places. First, the wonder ful technology that computers have is amazing. They can surf the web in milli-seconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on china, many search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a little time, you could have all the information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer-users have fast internet, and they reccommend it to other, first-time buyers. The computer that I use is a unique computer that was customizable to my liking. I like playing games and editing videos, so I got an outstanding graphics car that has outstanding speeds for rendering videos. This let me play games and edit videos, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my programs and projects, for future use. Doing many things on the computer can really help your hand-eye coordination. In fact, about @PERCENT2 of computer say that over a using a computer. they were to type @PERCENT3 quicker that they could before. Thats a very good number, but the average person woh types could write in @NUM2 in I have. I can type a that big in about @NUM3 minutes because it have been typing in other @NUM3. Computers are a big part of my life and I still have time to do other things with my family, and friends. The last thing that computers help us people with chatting with friends on websites, like facebook, myspace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share with all of your friends, and of you needed to, you could chat with far away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about things. I have a causing who graduated college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our gets together, we webchat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, blazing fast speed to chatting with distant relatives. These are key factors that show us that you can have fun on computers and still have time for family and friends.

Hi do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercis and you will not enjoy the outside nature with talking and playing with your friends and family will do not because computers are need for over needs and one click can help lot of people and can save live and the more advances over technology become. We will all so advances like or help a person look for a need jod and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late there has been controversy of how Computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people negative. My main reasons of this argument are. The persons health their the users well being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese @NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic. If a person is eating unhealthy but sizing. They can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the. They become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other. It also could prevent a person from excersicing. If they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch tv you could picture perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person. Now because of computers he is a @LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up eats breakfast. (The of about ), then plays on the computer untill lunch. He eats a small lunch and right back to playing. After along @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hows of playing. He off the computer, hopps into goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off but all he does is online. He cant interact with his family and this has a huge infact on it. Even though he could get off and talk one of the only ways of talking to him are through facebook. Now because of this family is. We can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts. My final argument for you is the users well being teen many of us have a facebook of @CAPS3 I have homework I to use the internet for facts and stories. @CAPS3 I do so to go on facebook. If anyone dows the effect our grades. If we chat on facebook we doing our. If arent doing our homework we wont get a good grade. If we could less to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay. It could be addicting and you might rely on it "once a to kill himself because he dident have his computer". So @CAPS2 you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could many problems inthe future like health. the family happiness. So spread the word for the sake of thousands of people.

Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computers brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glare at this letter.

Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them.

Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently writen in your newspaper on computors. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can find information for protect or article in far less time then searching through books, you can get important news updates and entertainment is only a click away. My first reason was at the information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on acient egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hiroglipics in a dictionary that would take a few minutes, online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours scouring textbooks untill you finally found it. on time it might take your just over a minute. The second reason I like computors is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is doing. Also computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue do so for a long time. The weather can always be found on time web for any in the world. This is a bad thing if you're planning a trip somewhere, wich you can also do with a computor. My third and final reason is that its hard to get bored on a computor. Every where on the web are cool gamesor funny videos. On the web there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other places like facebook let you share picures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored go on your computor, and have fun.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. One of the biggist problem that I think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. So thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me.
<START>

Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality.
<START>

My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have herd a complaint that and more people are using computers and getting less exsercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts @MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer alot still exercise. Take twitter as a example. The football player ocho-cinco "tweets" all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit. Most of the kids in my grade including me have a facebook. Most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer alot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use wikipedia for are projects and research a person. Some schools know a day almost depend on computers. I rember when I lived in country we never had to reely type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3 I am always typing something. Even a rough draft they want me to type. In couentry I would write out my final draft. I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer @CAPS4 as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more. When someone. Finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and @CAPS4 on. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, other family members have a facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends. The people that are the computer alot that are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends evey once in a while. Computers also benefit Society for buisness people they might have to a powerpoint and they have a computer. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more excising they might be right but we can do all these things but we can also still go on the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise you would see that you can do both.
<START>

Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the "great deals" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a "great deal?" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference. If someone is making a project at a school. Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance, they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community. In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together.

The computer effects peoplelife by taking them away from their family and have is @NUM1 reasons why the computer effect the people lives. @NUM2) They do not know what is happening outside. @NUM3) Their family @NUM1). Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives! My first reason their they don't know what happening out ide because they are to much busy on the computer. Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening. They akk to feel like they are going to cause they dont have their computer. Or the computer shot doen and he cant enough money to get a electriction. Those were all ny reasons. @NUM2) they don't know what is happening outside. @NUM3) their family @NUM1) Their job. Thank you for listening to my reasons.

Today in our society almost everyone uses computers weather @CAPS4 to do research, play games, or interact with others. These are all positive things. The schools across america are using computers from @NUM1 grade to online colledges. People benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @CAPS2 anyone who has a brain can relize that computers are a positive in todays society. First off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. you can play on them, and interact with others the reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 a good thing because if you need to get work done you can do that if you need research @CAPS1 can do that and @CAPS1 can help you In any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand eye cordonation but @CAPS1 also exersises you brain and can be a learning for young children. The reasons that interacting through the computer @CAPS4 that you learn how to be and talk through email for buisnesses and,make many @CAPS2 pleases use your brain and that computer our society today. @CAPS2 to keep on going americans are the smartest people in this world and our very well. I @CAPS3 have to you like and that @CAPS4 why we send every one of them to school @NUM2 of every year. Will that said they use computers anyone to say that computers are bad the that you love do while this. That useing computers and benifiting your life. @CAPS2 as you can see that computers are a thing for the good and can benifit to days saciety @CAPS2 I beg you for your sake please use computers and benifit your life. Its for your own good.
<START>

Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers make a big role in monern cicity. For this reason I think that @CAPS4 should take the advantige that @CAPS4 have. @CAPS4 could do lots of things. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 related @CAPS6 @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS4 could also chat online. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 related @CAPS6. Like homewrok and projects. @CAPS4 could use it for info on a project or homework. @CAPS4 could use it for the @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and @CAPS10. and many other reasons why @CAPS4 should have @CAPS12 for @CAPS7. @CAPS4 could use the computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Like making holiday and birthday cards. Pay bills for morgiges online. @CAPS4 could book a hotel online. @CAPS4 could play on or agentst with online games. @CAPS4 use for bidding on ebay or amazon. Pay bills for long distance calling. @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS13 if you missed it. Or just @ORGANIZATION1 shows in general. @CAPS4 could use it for chatting online. Like sendding emails or talking on ooVoo. So thats why @CAPS4 sould take the advantige.

Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people. and computers can make our live s a little easier. Thats whay I think we should keep computers in our society.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers. Our students all are benificial to our world today." @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of trajedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn go first? Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her neice and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos a family therapist says @NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after seperating through internet." @CAPS8 could anyone, ever leave those who you care most about behind? @CAPS3 a world with a full education, for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time. Thats the world we we live in.

@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. They're some people that are having less family and friends times. I say its computers!" This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get adicted to it. We need to reach a messgae to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people "why were they there?" "for homework" said a teenager. Another, "just to come and paly". I also ask, "how do they stay fit?" "I don't like @CAPS1 fit" said beautiful lady. "@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area. If you looking up the out doors on a computer, now thats a of time, that you could have been with a family member in the or where ever. My father says its great to buit its to live it. The days are getting shorter lets live it like."

Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type. Once the @CAPS1 get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of future learn & with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able ti teach them solves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? You'll get ot learn there cultures. Would you want to know something about? They make daily go around, there you'll you? Well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connect. Oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.

Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes. I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this.
<START>

I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice-president of a drug producing company which sold oxy-cofin they had to have a grocery @CAPS5 ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can'@CAPS1 fit them just in this story, @CAPS6 finally rember people whole lives are on their computers.

The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool. You can also become better well friends with people you didn't know that wll, by saying hello, or how was your day. You can also email. If you meet someone you made friends with on vacation you can email them. You can also go to websites where you can talk to people in other countris. If you have a webcamyou can even video chat, and ask them questions about their country, or what they like. Also you can videochat with all yor friends to. Using a computer you can learn about places arounf the world. If you were going to a place ypu didn't know, you could look up the amazing resraurants, you could also look up fun things to do with the family. If you needed to do a projecct you can look up what the weather is like, and what the people do. if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why compujters are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places arounf the world.

@ORGANIZATION1, The delema over computers needs to be noticed. People need to relize computers are one of the greatest inventions we have in our time, but in my opinion people take that as an advantage and misuse them for purposes that they should not be used. Computers are not meant to be for playing games, or constently instent messaging. They are meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computars for things that they dont need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not ment to be for that, they are for school and work. @ORGANIZATION2, word, @ORGANIZATION2, and powerpoint, if computers were used for those purposes people wouldnt be the way they are today. In the @LOCATION1 the computer is very popular people aboulutly love it! But these people are the people who are unfriendly, mean and sad. They also are incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people. They also have so much knowledge and there is never a dull conversationthem. Those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I am trying to say is that people who use the computer suceed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand the computer, but people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they dont know to much, they had average grades and they are unhealthey.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.

The topic that is on many minds in our country is, "Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?" @CAPS1 have evolved from dosktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits defin out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, solgiers rely on computers for valueable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the "dirty work" can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmaned airieal vehical and some many lifes too. Weather it be facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortuneatly, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost.
<START>

In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can effect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life.

Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at apples new @CAPS1, a desent rized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being one the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthrightus and takes time @CAPS5 of exersizing; one of the thing manhy @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending has too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight many people spent large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying @CAPS5 your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging. The sun will instatntly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damges your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think "well they can't get any worse." @CAPS5 the truth is they can not only is the light and the amount of time spent during a being onthe computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision but even more damaging to people without. can be genetic or common to people who constently their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend exeessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. Its a way to instantly gossip or chat with freinds. But it takes alot of typing. Typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. if this constenity happens to you you could be a canidat for arthrightus. No letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt, if you never let them take a break they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want artrightus. Because of all this new technology less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exersize. That @MONTH1 be way many @CAPS2 are over weight. Being on the computer for to long takes away time you could use to exersize or get some fresh air.

I tink that a computer is a good idea because when people are online they like to talk to there family and see them by the video cam. When you dont want to go out or your just go online and pay us . Like would you like to be no because when you watching a movie that you like your be like oh " go clean your room" and you go like "oh wait this movie is good." The computer are the best system for go online every body use computer. Witout computer how you going to cheak your yahoo @CAPS1. My moom love to be on @CAPS2. How you going to check your message if u dont know have a computer. If they lake computers out of sle every body is going to try to make one. and the people from walmart is going to be like they making more money than me llike the people from but buy they got good computers. no one is to make people to get people offline. Apple store have when people go over and buy some computers. When they be spending all the time on the is because they like to be online. If i like onlie you are not going to take the computers and say u searching mor in the computer. But is all bout computers when your mom is all ways at your house boring do go bu a computer whne you get money.

Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them. Because they teach hand eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people. @CAPS3 first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand-eye coordination skills when we type to @CAPS2 the letters. This helps us increase our Hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, @CAPS2 the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also when we type long passages it increase our hand eye coordination becaue we get used to wrighting the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases,which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not @PERSON1 free of the @ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @NUM1 people who type essays instead of wrighting them by hand, have a greater hand eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places. For example computers make it easier to reaserch far away people and places. Useing a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places withought a trip to the library. Also computers allow us to @CAPS2 us to @CAPS2 more info about recent events that have just around the world. Also computers make it faster to reserch topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressfull, not to mention dificult. Also informat on a computer can never be checked out or not availible like library books. Lastly you have information right at our fingerries so you will never have to leave youre house, @CAPS3 last reason is that computers allwo us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also it helps us talk to our parents if theyre away or if you're on a camping trip. Chating on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you dont know and block people you dont want talking to you. So in a sence you can be in controll of your friendships and who youre friends with. Computers are the greatist advance in technology sence the wheel and they have helped so many people.

Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time

@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe."

Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is "@CAPS1 im on the computer" then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible. This should have conclude you that computers nessesary in our every day from communication, to very things computers have helped us and will to help us in the future.

Dear whomever it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good. I think this for a few different reasons. Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out, people; especially students loose penmanship skills, and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things. They make us lazy!! Because of computers people don't go out. They don't go for walks because their doing something on the computer. There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a lot of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for whatever company right from their home computer. People can even finish highschool and college on their computers, by taking online courses! That brings me to @CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people. Students, can now type out all assignments, some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice. Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet. You can find any and everything on the internet, from math books to dictionarys and other resource books. Because of this some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find needed information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality. When they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are "more important things" to do on the computer. I personally think they are brain-washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer. Based on everything I just said I don't think computers have a very good effect on effect on people. They are makeing the world a very uptight and controlled place to be and based on that selected information, I'm sure you can see why.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people don’t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about "Computers".
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you think our excersizing and being in nature is becoming less and less? I don't think so in my opinion. I think computers is a positive effect because it can help you connect with other people from different parts of the world. Learn different stuff or how to's to make life easier. Be in-touch with far-away relatives. First of all, I believe computers is a positive effect because you can connect with people from different parts of the world. You can talk about thier culture. About how the, whats thier tradition of marriage or etc. The schools, and ask them questions. Secondly, I believe computers is a positive effect because you can learn stuff from it and how to's to make life easier. Because you can learn it easier with different under standing it better so you. Study from the to's to get school. Thirdly, I believe computer is a positive effects far away relative. If you talk to them in a long time wondering how there doing what they life. When we meet up catch. In conclusion, technology will basically help you in the future well. The marvolous computer will help you be in-touch with really good familys and friends. Now its time to @CAPS3! because the fancy technology will be here till years too come!

Would you ever think that a computer can take to much time or keep you from doing lots of things. Does using a computer mess up your life in some ways I would say no. The computer is common life everybody needs it or uses it in some way of form. People need it because they look a news when they could not catch it on @CAPS1 so they go to the amazing technoliga. We have witch is the @CAPS2.C of laptops or phone with internet. This just is a natural thing in are lifestyle now the computer does not stop you from going outside and playing other things its you say no I love this tecnoligy do much that I want to stay on it. So does the computer mess up someones life in anyway or is it just you. The beautiful things a @CAPS2.C can do for you. A computer can do lots of things for you wont want to leave it and go do other things, like you have lots of home work and a project that you need I @CAPS4 for so you go do your work and you can also listen to music and type your project and doing things even though your not outside playing and being active doesn't mean that your not doing somethings better for your life like typing faster for a job when you get older and nowing how to use a @CAPS2.C good and not being out of touch with family there is cameal. @CAPS2.C's have been around for a long time and eversince this world has had them we have been smarter more talented in most ways and kids and adults are in touch with wats going around us and how the world is acting technology has helped many people when they needed something done in a rush or for mostly everything they have been around for things the @NUM1 year old people can still go. Research things that they have never known. And find out billions of aplications for it. Although most people stay on for long periods of time but they cant stay on all day without say hi to family and talking to them. So has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be. So would you think that a computer is tacking to much time in a persons day and they are not spending enogh time with family or is it just that compturs are a all natural thing that everybody needs.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. Like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble. The computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something. Computers also have something called microsoft and microsoft is something that help you do writing projects and things like that. Computers help a lot of people cause like I said earlier it has games and some of those games have to do with school such as science, math, reading, and social studies so it is very helpful. Computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it most teens liketo go on something called myspace. Myspace is a thin that you can have freinds all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. If you go on myspace and have friends from different state or the same state you that they world want to find you and rape you. They would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live. Another reason its bad is because when @NUM1 graders go to the middle school @NUM2 grader will tell the inaproperate websites and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. Well you heard my opoin I hope you understand thank.

Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason I believe this is true is that kids can go "braindead" as some people call it. Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.

Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, Less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. Dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. People should at lest get @NUM1 of exercising. You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @NUM2. Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. People just cant take @NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people cant. Its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. You dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. My third reason is that interacting with friends an family. It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. Dont get me wrong I have a @CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis. So I dont see why its so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family. So I hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what I think. I hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer @NUM4.

Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends everyday on the @CAPS1. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when its raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events. Whenever I go into @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I woudn't be able to see who woll last nights ball game or whats happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn mopre about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather. During school I type up my essay. When I get home I check the homework and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. i rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly beleive that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up. It keeps me up to date with currents. I think computers have become part of our daily life.

Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers then spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computer haves on people, because one it allows us to access information, two it allows us to interact with people. And three because it helps us updated on what is happening in sports or everything. My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information, like the weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tell's us how @LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake. It tells us alot of stuff. It allow's to go to other websites to find information to. And it allow's us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can help us on our homework. And it can help us find things like job and other stuff. My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people. We can talk to people weve never ever met before. We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte. it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them. It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them. And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time. My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players. And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer. And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans. In conclusion this why we should use computers because it can give us information all over the world, two it can allow us to interact with people weve never met before. And three it will keep us updated on sports we like to catch especially if your a sports fanatic.

With more and more people using computers. I think that this does not benifit society. I think this because mere cases of suicide are from online bullying, people get @CAPS2 addicted that they don’t exercize and become obeast, and because it is bad for the environment. Now more than ever before people are bulling. But not just showing kids around like they use to. Now the bullies found a new way, by starting web pages, emailing the person, or making threats online. With the internent people say things that they would'nt be able to say in person because you dont have to see face to face all the time. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online. The bullies get into that person head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them. If we didnt have as many people going online then the youth would be more protected from online predilors. As you sit on the computer and play games or to friends, you are most likely caling. Well when you eat and stay on the computer you arnt exercising. Well, more than @PERCENT2 of obeast people say they don't exercise because they are either to tired or dont have enough time. Of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen. When they say they don't have time but yet they spend an hour a day on the computer. That dosnt make much to me. Obeasity has becomea big concern it is the main cause of head problems. @CAPS2 get active The enviorment is a big concern these days. With toxic, the @CAPS1 layer and skin cancer on the rise. But how does the computer? Well computers use energy and let toxix for environment. Killing the @CAPS1 layer @CAPS2 the are much more powerful, hurting people. Yes and plant do help the @CAPS1 layer but when you print you @CAPS2 you @CAPS2 very hard to keep up with the demand of and the demand of the @CAPS3 have to eat, but with out trees, plants they eat? By the time our children's childrens are here, there @MONTH1 be @CAPS3 to no wildlife left, barely any wilderness and without the @CAPS1 layer many people will die of skin cancer. All because we are @CAPS2 addicted to using the computers. People lives, health, and the environment are all big issues that computers help to distore. How would you feel walking into your childs bedroom seeing them on the floor dead from being bullied on the computer. Or see a loved one suffer from heart problems due to obeasity becasue they couldn't get off the computer. Or in about @NUM1 years the @CAPS1 layeris completly distroyed due to the computers, with @CAPS3 to no wildlife left. Using computers does not benifit society. Sure its a quick look up. But @CAPS2 are books. The computer has every thing a local libeary has. @CAPS2 stop being lazy and get out. Put a stop to suicides, obeasity, and hurting the environment.
<START>

Do you ever have time to read? Do you ever spend time with your family? Or do you ever have time to go outside? Well, if you don't, it's because you spend to much time on the computer. Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, read a novel, you can ask your parents to drive you to the library. I understant that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would @CAPS1 that computer @MONTH1 have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation were they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I @CAPS1 what that is like. My family lives in @LOCATION2 and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply, go on your @CAPS4, its hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed these until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in @LOCATION1 wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excersizing. In addition just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't lonely. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them, its better safe, then sorry to do it the old fashion way.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many oppurtunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other, they allow people to research topics in a simpler way, and they teach hand-eye coordination. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether @CAPS1 is at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we neven knew. Sometimes we @MONTH1 use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is @CAPS1 quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier. @CAPS1 might take a while, but over time people get the hang. @CAPS1's as @CAPS1 the computer is letting you teach yourself. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.
<START>

In this modernized world computers are key. They offer many benefits that enclude communication, enterntainment, and an education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benifit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed. The most important function of the computer is education. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that @MONTH1 be brought up in a class room. It comes to be very useful for research projects or even learning another language. The computer is a very beneficail when ti comes to education. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has come to be incorperated with almost any daily task that @MONTH1 occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer is a technology that greatly benifits our communication, our entertainment, and even our education.

Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people. My opion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something @MONTH1 pop that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house. When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much. When in the house on the web most people that excersise stop excersising. The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you don't want to get up. This leads into eating unhealthy foods. Some such as chips, donuts, twinkies and etc. Some @CAPS1 do not believe that is an opinion. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote "@CAPS2 that are more active are healthier than @CAPS2 that stay on the computer all day. Most @CAPS1 do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity @CAPS4) cloged arteries or @CAPS5) lazyness. It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day. Most @CAPS1 should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer. There is a lot more to life than being on the web. Some such as playing sports. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same tim it is also healthy. Would you rather live to @NUM1 or live to @NUM2. And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today. I mean would you rather have friends @CAPS2 or be lonely. There are weight surgerys but those can rack up to thousands of dollars. And yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death. So come on @LOCATION1 its your decison and remember the most important part of this letter which is between liveing healthy and young or dieing unhealthy and suffer. Its your choice @LOCATION1 decide.
<START>

Computers are a good benefit to society they you to talk to people give different for you the the latest updates. First they allow you to chat with friends they allow you to message anytime you want. You can talk to people the faraway you lose. For example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time. Also when your bored it will give you something to do. You could see if anyone wants to make plans to hangout. And if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people. Secondly it gives you new ideas on things. It shares oppions. Maybe someone bought same they and it did not work you could see the comments and review. Would you want to spend you money on some thing that did network? I woudn't. You can also see majority of people like what they got. Also they make you think of something you would not think about before say you had are mark about how this horrible maybe if you read the page it online it shows what you did wrong what you did not do. It gives you the to try something you @MONTH1 enjoy what you get. Lastly it gives you the latest updates it can share if the sched is closed, delayed, or open. You wouldn't have to wait for the news to show it. It can tell you about crimes that are happening. Also it tells you about your town. Who dont want to know whats going on your own? It tells you new things that are in your town or what their going to make or it tells you what it is getting rid of. Computers are they lot us chat with friends and family. It gives us thoughts we @MONTH1 have never thought about before and they tell us the newest updates.

Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the comuter, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to colledge because of his career. He decided to get a colledge degree, so he started to attend a colledge. He had difficulty being in colledge, however, because he was constantly being harrassed by his fans, so he started going to colledge online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harrassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains progams that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create @CAPS2 documents such as peoms, essays, song lyric, and even letters. You can print out these @CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your ownn to keep and show people wherever you go, but if your not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so one. Over the years that its been existance, its benefited us al lot. What do you think?

Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live to far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just havent got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the "@CAPS1 massacre" and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgetten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never new. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher!

Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quictly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today.

My opinion on the effects computer have on people. A good effect that computer have on people that it teaches them how to have good hand-eye coordination @CAPS1 if they work as a doctor on anything that needs it that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people it let them chat with their famile memebers case if your family went to a whole new countries for a trip then you beable to see how there doing and it's like there. Another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world.  It tell you how many people like there and what type of culture they have when it found probably now when I want to learn about texas I look up information on it and tell me when it was found the capital and how many people live there. Another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type.
<START>

I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer.

@ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well.

Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I believe so fo various reasons that I will state through out this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on computer it doesn't mean computers are bad for society it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They are able to make everyday life easier. They allow you to store information. Learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family. For one device to do all that is amazing! Also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all! Anouther reason why I believe computers greatly benifit society is because they provide entertainment. You can watch movies on your computer, and download fun games. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are very great to have around. Now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, like the expression "guns don't kill people, people do." In conclusion I believe computers are a great thing to have espicially in this modern society. Computer are one of the greates advancements in technology and they benifit society as well. So if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer I suggest you get one!

Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding the math. Then, I went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be useful for a school project on a country. Also @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think omputers have a postive effect on people. Lastly, I think computer have a positive effect on people becuase you can interact with people around te world. I have a brothter that lives in florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want. I think computers help people develop better social skills. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a postive effect on people for better grades, learn different things, and talk to friends.

Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community. If the library's closed and a students needs information, you can look it upon the internet. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phones not working. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixecl. First of all, computers can help with research alot. Let's say it's ranning healthy, your car? out of gas and you need to go to the library before it closes. Just be easier to go on the computer and find a research site about your topic; no gas wasted, no sopping wet doing just you in a robe sipping hot choclate on the computer. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long distance call. And if yo udon't have unlimited minutes and you went to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in. You can just open a chat window and talk away, just like that. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something happened that you needed to know about you could just go on the internet and look it up. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes.

Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers have a bad effect on people? Many people say "yes" and many say "no." @CAPS3 a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 have a bad effect. People are very easily distracted on computers, it wastes time, and it causes stress. Many kids who @CAPS2 there homework on computers are very easily distracted. With computers come the internet, and with the internet comes games and social networking sites. Many kids would rather chat on facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me. When I get home, I start using the online text book for my math class. But when I wait for it to load I get bored and go on online game website. After that I get too distracted on this addicting game called "@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1." And @NUM2 hours of playing online games I realized I have wasted a lot of time. I realized I have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting game. And @PERCENT1 of my grade in math is homework I've gone from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+. And why waste time on the computer. Outdoors are just @CAPS3 fun @CAPS3 "@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1." I'd rather be playing football with my friends than that dumb game. My parents have also realized that I've been wasting so much time on the computer they've blocked the internet. But distracting games that waste time also cause stress, which could be fatal. Imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer. Once while I was watching the @ORGANIZATION1, a man said @NUM4 people died because of playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water. My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long. And I've been stressed lately. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people. Distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress. Hopefully people understand this message and you shouldn't play on computers for too long.

Dear who it @MONTH1 concern, I think that computers are very affective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or lets say some children smoke and some hang out in the streets to much yeah it does do a lot affect to them. In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it.

Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says "With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game." @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to "be in the game." You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have "hand-eye" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that "rich." I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands.

Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology "I phone" or "@CAPS1 ". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic.

@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true.

My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the @MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.
<START>

Dear local Newspaper I believe that computers are a great help to society I will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. I hope you agree with me after reading this. For starters, I would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online @NUM1 usually, so you will always be able to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program @CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not fisned! There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, reading, book sites all on the web! This gives the opprotunity of the "web searcher" to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. Finaly, I would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! There are many to choose from like videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. On a game a user @MONTH1 talk to friends, while @CAPS14 a game such as a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) for example @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @CAPS14 a @CAPS8 @CAPS9. Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertennent is @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. To sum this all up I would like to tell you Local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! Please reread and pick the right @CAPS2!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them "@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to. This @CAPS2 I thinck they should put and @CAPS2 they should pick.

What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is.

Computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people learn about news in the world, places and people. Computers can also help people communicate with each other. Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports. Computer should be part of societys everyday life. Computer have a positive effect of people and they can help people learn new things, like, places, people, and news in the world. Computers are very benefital to society.

Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the @LOCATION1 over use computers these days. I think that instead of home on your lazy and playing farmville and pets on facebook you should get out more. I think that you should @CAPS8 the gym and work out you should @CAPS8 out to the park or have family fun night with your kids (@CAPS1 you have any) The last thing I think you should @CAPS7 is @CAPS8 have a little "@CAPS2" time for example take your self somewere nice (you'll about time in a second) @DATE1 all you've done is sit home playing farmville and other games and what not you probably get really fastly and you eating right? well @CAPS1 @CAPS3.... boy you gained some pounds of the @DATE1 and you look you need to get your self to a gym. from sitting on your while on the @CAPS9 every day you any calories or fat @CAPS3 when you eat all your doing is gaining weight. and @CAPS4 you probably don't want to. @CAPS7 you have a family? Well @CAPS1 you @CAPS7 I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a fun way @CAPS3 you can get your hands off those keys and your head with your kids. Also you should make other nightfamily fun night and play games and hang out with family on family fun night you can play characles or a board game. (as long as you don't have a in your house) The last my favorite one is "@CAPS4" Time. During "@CAPS4" Time you can take your self shopping out to lunch/dinner you even take a map the whole point of "@CAPS4" Time is that You @CAPS7 NOT @CAPS8 ON THE @CAPS9!! you need to relax and just take a brake. Well those are my suggestions to you. @CAPS3 now its your turn to jump on out of virtual world and put your head back in reality.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are easy to learn how to use, you can connect with old friends, and even learn by going to an online school or college they offer. Computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology. Remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. This technology can help you more than it can hurt you.

Dear local newspaper, Are computers a bad thing? Certainyly not! They can be distracting but in a enlighting way. How? Computers give you extra knowledge, you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise, they do not, they can actually help exercise! My first reason that computers are a positive device to have is they can give you extra knowledge. That is great for the brain! When you are sitting at home with a ton of, think again, the computer is there for you. Ask or search anything and you should have a @PERCENT1 guarentee your answer will be found! If you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you. Just one computer can enlighten you with so much. Now when you go back to school you can brag and say "@CAPS1 you know,?" People will be amazed. Lately experts have been concerned that the computer device is a distracting item and it will keep you from exercising and enjoying nature, @CAPS2, no need to worry you can learn just nabcur anything on nature when you surf the web! You @MONTH1 find out more of what is in your maryard then you already knew. Exercise! Are you worried you do not get enough exercise? @CAPS2 then, go onto youtube.com, type in exercise and work out. You will come up with millions of exercise routines you can do right infront of your computer. Another thing you can do it get online for how to stay healthy and exercise! Lastly the experts is have been that we people are not having a sccial life and interacting with our family and pals. I would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online then we do in public. With sites like facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and more we are talking to those people instantly! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there. Sometimes we have family that lives long distance, no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect! In a nut shell, knowledge, exercise, and connecting with buddies are all positives in the computer. You can multi-tase so simply with just one electronic device and that is the computer! Experts, you do not need to worry.

Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computer have good or bad effects on people? It has been bought to @CAPS10 mind that people fight about @CAPS3 computers to @CAPS2 a doubt I think that computers have a positive on people. @CAPS10 think arguments are people find ability in talk online with other people and help with school work. First of all computers gieve in ability to learn about faraway places. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 you want to learn about @CAPS4 you can go at the computer end google "@CAPS4 @CAPS6". By doing this you'll find a lot of info on @CAPS4. I should I tried it before. So that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society. Second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you want to learn about people from around the world. This is different than googling fatcs about other people. This is free because @CAPS3 you google @CAPS3 your online chat with someone you have a In @CAPS10 thoughts thats the best way to is helpful friends and family @CAPS3 they dont have of all computer can help with school work. This is helpful students could and the world or about a different This remind me of the time I had to @CAPS1 a project about the nine planets. I had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading. So these I the easiest and fastest way to @CAPS1 @CAPS10 project. I went on the internet in @CAPS10 and get all the info that I needed. So then I completed @CAPS10 project and headed it in to @CAPS10 teacher. She gave me a @PERCENT1 for a project grade. I got a @PERCENT1 because I misspelled @CAPS10 name, but that doesnt matter. What I am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects. @CAPS2 thinking I know that computer have a positive effect on @CAPS10 three arguments is that computers give you ability to learn about faraway places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take @CAPS10 side and think that computers have a positive effects on human society.

Dear, local news time editor using a @CAPS1 daily has a positive effect on people, wouldn't you agree? People should use a @CAPS1 more often. I think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house, they were invented for a reason. Computers allow you to interact with friends and family, help you with school work and, I guarantee that you will have a good time using a @CAPS1 by playing games and meeting new people. If you have school work to finish, computers help will work. If you need to do some research, you can just go to a website google and what you needed to know will be right in front of your eyes in a matter of seconds. Computers can help you with as well. There is icon inside one of your documents. I read an article on @CAPS1 about @PERSON1 stated that "@CAPS1 users are most likely to succeed in school." Interacting with friends and family is always a . Maybe you do not understand if you have been assigned in a certain class. You @MONTH1 add a friend and you will tell you what has . Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your socical life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the @CAPS1. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named "@CAPS2". I garantee you will have a good time using a @CAPS1. There are many games out there that you @MONTH1 enjoy. Playing these games, will teach hand-eye coordination, says @PERSON2. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As you computers have a lot of positive effect on people. You can interact with family and friends, recieve a lot of help for school work and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a @CAPS1.

How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.

Dear local newspaper I support the advances in technology. I am going to tell @NUM1 thinks way. One is on a rainy day. I don’t think you are going to go out an play in the rain so you could go on the computer and play games. Talk to friends. Or you could use the computer for school work or for work. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the liebery, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something with them online. Last things you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So that is why I support advanes in technology.

Dear @CAPS1, Everyone love computers right? Those computers can help us with anything. They also give people facts about faraway places. And not only that but if you have someone that live's away, you can chat with them online! What would this world be with no computers. First of all, I would like to talk about how computer can help us with anything. Computers can give us picture of places, you can watch videos, and even see movies for free! Also you can check the weather, and if going to an airport you can check the flight time or if it has been canceled or not. There is just so many things that the computer can help us with! Now, it can also give you facts opinions, pictures, videos, and movies about faraway places. Like one time I was going to @LOCATION1 to visit but there was a terrible storm over there so the flight was canceled and I went on the computer and checked and it told me that it was canceled. Also if you somewhere faraway you can watch videos about that place. They also have maps to guide you through the way. And not only that but you can also check the highway for traffic so you wouldn't be stuck there. Wow imagine living without a computer! Third of all, if you can chat online with your friends or family! If you miss someone or you just want to talk there is websites that let you do that. Like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4! And you also see the person if you attach a camera to you computer, it's called video-chatting. And you can do this anyone, anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all of this can only be done with a computer. Helping you with anything. Giving people facts about faraway places. And, you can talk online. There's many more but for you to know that you'll need to go to the store and get yourself a computer!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I understand that there has been somethings going on with computers. People think they're good. People they're bad. Other people just don't care. People just don't understand the present day. Society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids. People just don't get modern day society. I'm going to tell you the advantages and disadvantages to computers. There are a lot of advantages to computers. You can find information fast. Communication with people around the world is a huge advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained. There are games on websites. Computers are the thing we use today. A lot of things are done by computers, computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google it. There are a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money. Computers can down. There could also be dumb websites that have no purpose like facebook and myspace. Computers are complicated if you don't grow up with them it's hard to learn. The government has all they're information in computers. If they didn't people would be able to steal information a lot. Computers are the greatest thing we've invented so far. It helps with a lot of tasks these days. There are infinite numbers of information in the world and computers help find it. I hope that this letter informed you more about computers. Good and bad things come from this. But, it is mostly good. Kids and teens would be so bored that they would the parents insane.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! lets make a shange so we can do all of these things!

Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordiantion. You can also learn about different people and places. But it also allows us to communicate with the people online. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Because it's rely important to have hand-eye. And when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. So it's rely important to have hand-eye. Another reason why I feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. So technacally it's preparing you for life. My final reason why I think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a posotive effect on people. And if you don't believe me go hop on a computer and see for yourself. You won't be dissapointed.

Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting infront of there computers all day long. There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country. Well here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occure more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show just look online you will find it. Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away.Second, enjoying nature is a scarse thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. there are much less people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don'@CAPS1 care about the enviorment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more fun to internet on their place that they on. There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away thrills poeple used to have of going places getting out of the house seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through computer. Third, there are for less interactions personaly between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential. People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet. Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can'@CAPS1 see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than infront of a computer. Why don'@CAPS1 they see that?

Dear local newspaper, it has came to @CAPS2 attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them. In @CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have approprate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obiese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a "@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldnt get into these websites. many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends. For example when a friend calls and asks @CAPS2 brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook, @CAPS2 friend once said to me "sorry I can't go to the pool today I am going to play rollercoaster tycoon." With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from ecersising, expose kids to in approplate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. I hope everyone agrees thet computer aren't beneficial to people.

Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people in the world use computers one time in their lives. Wether it's looking up information, sightseeing, or clothing with friends people are on the computer. They use their computers for work and games @CAPS1 children use the computer to learn. Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand-eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are seeing new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news. You probally also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above. Most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers. Farmers @MONTH1 need to keep reports on their money income. Mechanics @MONTH1 use the computer to create blueprints, @CAPS2 officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates. Baby sitters @MONTH1 need to do their homework. As you can see @CAPS3 jobs use the computer. How @CAPS3 people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer? I know I do, @CAPS3 people meet freinds on the computer. Ever heard of @ORGANIZATION2? they macth people together. There is @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 more sites were you can chat with freinds. All of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society. They help people in any number of ways. I agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside.
<START>

I think that computers have great affects on people. Computers are a good way to @CAPS1 intouch with people, @CAPS2 online, @CAPS3 jobs, and @CAPS3 information on @CAPS4 facts. Computers might not be good exercise @CAPS5 you but at helps you in life and it also keeps you organised @CAPS5 example it keeps files @CAPS5 buisneses and @CAPS5 people that are in the music industry computers makes beats @CAPS5 them and can also record @CAPS5 them. computers helps every one in all ages. It helps the younger kids in school where they have to write a @ORGANIZATION1 or have to do a project, and helps the elderly peope @CAPS5 their jobs. Computers alson helps you know what is going on in life, like on the veiws see who has been hurt or the weather. Truely the computers are realty good @CAPS5 every thing they help you do so and it is really amazing how technologie changes. If it werent @CAPS5 come veters I dont think some of us would be where we are today.

Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 studied that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive effec on people. You can stay in touch with realtives. Also you can entertain you over long trips. Computers have positive effects on people. Computers let you stay in otuch with realtives keep up with friens and are a good of entertainment. If you have distant realtives you can keep in touch. Video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away. If you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up. Also if you are in the army and have a @ORGANIZATION1 baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their. Video chatting used only way to stay in touch but also you just talk even wihtout a computer. Aim and @CAPS1 let you see whats goign on with your friends that you might see everyday or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 lets you keep in touch with everything thats going on with things like status updates. Aim lets youtalk with just your keyboard whre you type messages to poeple. Mabey you want to go in to town with a friends just send them a message by @CAPS1 or aim. Computers a onley for staying in touch though you can stay while you travel around. COmputers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even rides. If you want to watch a movie just put in a dise or even rent on off itunes or netflicks. If you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your. Also you can even play video games on your computer. Just buy the game install it and then play. Computers are a great thing during down time and have positive effects on people. Computers let you keep in touch with family stay up to date with friends and are an excelent source of entertainment long trips or downtime. Computers are the lightbulb of the @DATE1.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too.

Dear local newspaper did you know that the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer? This is why I think that people are spending ton much time on computers. If people spent less time on computers they would exersice more, be outdoors more and spend more time with their family and freind. If people were to spend less time out computers than they would exersize more. With the growingproblem of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2 less time on computers would help this. Tests show that the less time spent on computers the more time spent exersizing. And with @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 obese this world help that problem alot. I once had a freind who would allways be outside exersie and playing. Then he got a @CAPS1 acount and he started to be home on the computer all day and would never be exersizing. Less time on computers would also time outdoors. Result from a I took at my school say tahat @PERCENT2 people would go outside if they couldn't use their computer. And it more people are outside will notice how nature is and @PERSON1 says that use of the electricity in a house. So if everyone of it have a effect on if to turn off their computers they would spent more time with friend and family. that there are to freinds and family on programs like @CAPS2, @CAPS1 and it is talking face to. And you could also do like to the and you see people. use @ORGANIZATION1 but you would need and it. I would be alot easyer and less it you would get of the computer and talk to them face to face. This is why I think that people are spending to much time on their computer and it is having a effect on their life. If they were off the computer they would spend more time exersizing, more time helping the environment and more time socializing with their family and friends. So please @LOCATION1 stop using the computer all the time.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and @CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is @CAPS1 keep our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. It is quick. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!

Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people. This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countrys like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can iteract with people you know and talk to them and use technowlogy to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have positive affect on society and the wayore live. First off computers help save the environment and they do this by leting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @NUM1 trees and they are all not imeditly taken to the mills to be turned into paper. But thet stopin piles at loging sites and are leftrotting there not be my put to good work or what they should be. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk with out a mouth. So when you cut down a tree its like robing. Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening. She one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society. Secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that is computers are use it can excellour learning and @MONTH1 been a lot more in a lot shorter time then we would have my to find a book or the subject what youre looking for. Computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things I when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finaly you can talk and interact with friends. techknowlogy has advanced so much that we don't see the world in prospective like take a cell phone for example what do you see mostly likly a phone. But if you open it up what to do you find? You will find a micro computer thats capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before. computers revolutronized the way we look at the world and techknowlogy we can talk and play games usiing this techknowlogy most of what we see every day used with techknowlogy hike, a game station or even a car rardo. adn all of it is used to help using ract with one on toher. So I veiw techknowlygy a so good thing. In conclusion techknowlogy has a positive and negative impact by more positive than negative influence. Techknowlogy help us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by button. Techknowlogy has revolunoized the wat mankind lives and how they veiw society but it us all a good thing in the end. And so I concluded that techknowlogy/computers have a positive and negative impact on socuoty.

Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.
<START>

Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies, hacker, and terrorists. Because. And the some I believe that child in the @LOCATION2

Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. (not finished!!!)

As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. @CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This @MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their "wall" but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and/or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier @LOCATION1? 
<START>

Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In adition everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air. Meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed!

Dear local newspaper, I feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another, give people info about different types of things, and make people smarter. To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you say? First of all, as some people say it doesnt let you interact with family members. Yes it truely does you can interact with both friends, and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim, meebo.web cam meeting such as skype.com. So that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn info about differnt types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a giraffe, cat, rat or learn about different places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1 etc... Also you could find all of this info at home in one day. Most important I would make people smarter the computer teaches you hand eye corrdinations for free. The computer can teach you about any career, or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed? To conclude computers have positive effect on people, it lets people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and it makes people smarter. Even I was done reading this it I thanked the lord for computer, it helps us so much.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, "@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?", and he answered, "They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination." @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending to much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of reaserching and things like that. I have three reason's why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend is a @CAPS5 first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room. @CAPS5 second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet. @CAPS5 final reason is because the interact influences violence. There are @CAPS5 three reason, on to here more. @CAPS5 reason number one why I say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that. This is why I say that the internet is not alway good to be on all the time if you aren't or learning about the nation. @CAPS5 second reason why I that speding too much time on the computer all the great sometimes is its taking away from your come in the and go to the computer instead of doing their homework on reading. @CAPS6 like computer sometimes more than they like is learned and thats not good because not knowing I could if they got up their is on the computer for educational games but they dont. reason why I am concerned that people using the computer a lot. @CAPS5 final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer to much is because the internet on the computer can influence @CAPS6 to be violent in @CAPS5 ways all games and going on yo all the that affects the world if they keep seeing violence and things in that nature frequently. I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives an image in more need and then @MONTH1 think its cool to do it because it @CAPS6 like @CAPS3 more than a book on the computer more than a look. When young teens see violence on the computer @MONTH1 think it's cool. This is @CAPS5 final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So these one some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them.

Dear @CAPS1, Technology such as computer is proven to have a positive effect on people. Computers teach you hand eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow, and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day. One way that computers benifit society is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes firmiliar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard with out even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand-eye coordination @CAPS2 playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this coordination. Computers also benifit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1; they can simply go online and type in @LOCATION1 under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didnt even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benifit our society. Lastly, computers and technology benifit our society becaus' they allow you to communicate with others, reconnect with old friend or family, or simply share the latest drama from your art class. I know when ever I'm at my computer my instant messanger is always open. It is something I utilize everyday in order to communicate with my friends and distant realitive. In conclusion, computers do benifit society, and they are proven to have a positive affect on people. Technology is like a sponge, it absorbs information and then continue to expand everytime you add more. *@CAPS2 doing this I am able to maintain healthy strong realationships with othe.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 "@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person." With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. "@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time," @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. "@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. "I have messy handwriting", @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. "@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me" @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good.

To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, "how make fire" a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computors are bad; I'd like to see you lost a week without using one.

Dear @LOCATION1, I @CAPS1 believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. Most @CAPS2 dont have textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class a parket, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. @PERCENT1 of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some kind of computer work. some jobs require quick typers. some people type as fast as cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 - Computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway communication @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online. if one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 gives me a way to talk to, @CAPS11 photos with and leave videos for my friends. One @CAPS12 @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all going to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was on @CAPS7. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, of @CAPS9? To @CAPS17, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends please @LOCATION1, @CAPS18 this in the Newspaper so all residents of @LOCATION1 will agree with me.

Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors I have recently read an atical that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well I agree with them. I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends. Well if you look at teen's this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their wasn't computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes. Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste well theis problems just don't go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it. Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer. When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place's in the world. Well I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can't you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see. And why can't you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends. Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can't really have conversation or talk to their parents. For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A's and @CAPS1's and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can't talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Well I know that as a @STATE1 newpapper editer you are a vary busy person and have lot of diffent things to do but I hope you take this in to concideration and remmember the importants of exercisin, enjoying rotune and interacting with familys and friends.

Dear @PERSON1, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. As a whole @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then dont exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to thier computer. While interacting with others they just keep on eating, most dont even know why they're eating. If we want to erase @LOCATION1 as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they wont know what the real world is actually like. Imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @CAPS1, they would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation. Free from temptation and independent human beings. We will rewrite ourself in history as the that made a chane and got rid of computers.
<START>

Dear newpapers journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has The highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer and work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus.

@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. The computer gives us all the things we need. Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals. I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I just think that that is a waste of time, when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. To me, that's a life saver. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In my own experiences, I've needed pictures on school projects. Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages who wants to write all that? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many website, like @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows, or want to watch music videos, there are websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activites. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who wants to do that? In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.

Yes, I agree with the concern that expert have. I say this because its true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family, there is also all kinds of danger online, and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me I'll prove it to you. First, people get addicted to the computer they forget about there family. Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook, but they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal expirience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online, for example when you got to those chat sessions where you meet people supposley your age, but it might not always be that way everytime on the news you see stories where old people try act like @NUM1 year olds, but they aren't they just want to do bad stuff. So you can be facing a lot of dangerd online. Lastly, by beign on the computer your not letting your brain get the good workout or exersice it needs. Your just letting it be there, but instead you can be reading a book or do a word seach puzzle; these are all good idea for making your brain exersice. On a recent research experts say that people spend time reading and exersicing their brains do very good on test, but people who spend most of the time in the computer fail test. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend to much time on a computer you have less time with your family. You can be facing serious danger, and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs. Did I convinced you yet?

I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, @CAPS1 people will spend @CAPS1 there time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you dont get off of for a while, why, because you are haveing fun. when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing, @CAPS2 dont pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when im bored not stay home because @CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that dosn't you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers, you gain your wheight you I read @NUM1 children in every years will be obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inacitivity means not active activity. @CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight @CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer. In conclusion you @MONTH1 have mixed thaught's @CAPS3 you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 doesnt matter @CAPS3 you go on just dont all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are and you will gain wheight @CAPS3 you spend all your time on the computer.

In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer.
<START>

Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need & friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family & friends now is up to you the rest.

You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possability of research, etc. Would be much more difficult. For example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @CAPS1 benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @CAPS2, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @CAPS1 time. Computers @MONTH1 take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology.

Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial affect on society. They have @CAPS4 many features. options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, "@CAPS1 not use a phone to talk to others." @CAPS2 these are many reasons @CAPS1 talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin @PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working @PERSON2 went down stars to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound, @PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones wren't opperating, i hopped to the computers in her room to quickly "chat" with my dad and tell him what happened. From these on, my dad called on ambulance and @PERSON2 was allright. @CAPS4, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save somenes life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a stuident has to write a paper for school about the @CAPS3, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of kodedge. All you have to do is go to a search engin such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there's millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knoledge on. @PERSON1, a high school teacher, states that "@PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and reseacrh." @CAPS4, there you have it, the computer's a great resource for information. One last reason computers are @CAPS4 beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long. The heard of the company is not going to hire you if you are not expierenced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer @CAPS2, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that "@PERCENT2 of buisnesses involve using a computer" Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second, it's important start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, a great source for knoledge, and bhelp prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place.

Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts are concerned about today's population's computer usage. With this I agre, as many children and adults are counted and labeled as obese, or overweigt. Technology has advanced as enough to having machines do everyday tasks, proving how lazy some @CAPS3 are now-a-days. People sit at home standing at a computer screen, forgetting about spending time exercising, enjoying nature, or being out and having fun with friends and family. Having a computer clearly interferes with one's @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in real @CAPS5, not the "@CAPS4 @CAPS5" of chatting with others over internet. Having applications released that connect people over the computer devastates the reason to leave your house. Now with video, you virtually meet the other person, showing how lonely and individually separate you can of from others. While your friends are having a party. You'll be absent, as I'm sure they won't have a webcame there. Another reason why a computer is not needed is many people neglect pure nature. When surrounded by new digital age. The beauty of the outdoors become forgotten. Sure you can watch videos, and look at pictures of nature, but is that really anything compared to the crisp, clean aid against your hair or the once in a lifetime animal actions you @MONTH1 see? Plus, nature and the fact of being outside @MONTH1 inspire you to continue a diet, or begin one, seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoor can be. It also serves as a great place to exercise. As we all know, obesity is a factor in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. But now, being oevrweight is at an all time high, claiming lives and causing many into depression. in my opinion, I believe this is highly realted to computer usage. Especially with fast food playing a role. People have not realized the need to exercise more often. In conclusion, you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation, and in a negative way. Computer using @MONTH1 be "ok" when used in moderation, like sweets or oily foods. it does serve as a way to pass time, for a while, but so does exercise... Which one would you think would end as a believe solution? Obviously, we must stop relying on technology to help, and begin activities ourselves again.

Dear @CAPS1, I belive that people are spending to much time one computors. I belive this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. @CAPS2 first reason is that people waste money on it. Also every thing they get from the computer you get from book. And finaly @CAPS2 reason is because of the "@CAPS8 crises." @CAPS2 first reason for say that people spend to much time on the computer is that people waste two much money on it. I belive this because of your electric bill and and @CAPS3 bill. The people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true becuse of the constant charging of laptops or running of computors. Also they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that bocome a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the dawn. @CAPS2 second reason for this is that anything and every thing you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I belive this because where do you think the website makers get there info from. Reading books also increase your knoledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information. @CAPS2 third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this "@CAPS8 crisis." @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This I cause less people to be phisicaly active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crises and computor are sadly con triputing to the world wide crisis. I eagerly hope that @CAPS2 letter hase helped you see @CAPS2 point of view on this subject. To show that people spend to much time on there computer because its a waste of money, anything you can get from a computor you can get from book, and because of the "@CAPS8 crisis".

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering been so of @PERSON1, fresh air more children They will be on websites all day insted of being on a. Sports teams because of computers. The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life thretening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it.

Computers are great, they can help you with anything you need. You can shop on then, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation, but people are spending too much time on them. They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer People ran often stay on the computer for hours and not even relize it, they stay up all @TIME1 doing work, or playing games. @TIME1 a while it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because @CAPS2 you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning. Then that leeds to feelings horrible in the @TIME2, @CAPS2 you do it @TIME1 it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. @CAPS2 you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever. Then when you eat you don't burn off the calories so that leeds to people gaining wait and becoming over wait from that your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely leed to health issues. When people are on the computer they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house with their fare glued to the computer. Being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children or friends. As long as they're out of there chair and not on the computer and getting some exercise.

Dear local newspaper, Computers are a usefull tool when doing a school report or something to that effect but, @CAPS2 we really need thoes computers. When using a computer for a school project @CAPS3 can be a hassel. One of many problems people are fased with while using a computer are freazing, when doing a project and your computer frezz's @CAPS3 can be verry time consumming. Another problem is pop up's, pop up's can couse virouses, and when you computer gets a virous, @CAPS3 leads to becoming very slow. Witch leads us to are next problem slowness, when a computer becomes slow @CAPS3 is verry a digital. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermet and stay inside all day because your too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become verry obease because your not getting any physical exersise. One risks of using a computer is that you could end up getting an fassebook, @CAPS1, or myspase, and meating some one who is protending to be some one there not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer. One alternation is that you could go to the local library and cheak out books on your topick that your wanting information on. Another alternation is to ask teachor if she/he could leand you a class text book. But the main aternation is computer to old fashon books! So now @CAPS3's your choice,"@CAPS2 we realy need computers or can we live with out them?" @CAPS3's your choice!

Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer.

To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.

Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.

Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you.

Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever used a computer to do anything besides buisness? Well if not then when you are not busy you should try it. The effects computers have on people is that it's a lot of fun to go on and play, helpful with mostly anything, and you can find just about anything from websites on clothing to maps to the store location. There are three reasons why you should agree with me and these reasons are people have the right to choose what they want to, in this weather it's a little bit to cold to go out and enjoy nature, lastly they can interact with friends and familys online on a website. People have the right to choose what they do because the goverment can't choose for you since they're busy with other more important stuff. Also in the constitution it states that the goverment can't choose for us while we have the power to think. In this weather it's cold to go out, plus nature is so much better in the @DATE1 and the @DATE2 where it's not to hot to cold and thats when the sun is good thats when people should enjoy nature. With all the technology in todays world it's better to take advantage of the technology in this world, also the technology we have is helping people like generators because in old times people didn't have generators. So I hope this letter has changed your opinion and thank you for reading it.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opion in thig is that, computer are used all the time. People use them to talk to friends and family online. People also use computers for home work online. And the last rason I say computer are used is just for fun stuff game you can play. I use the computer to look how @CAPS2 teams are doing. Now on to more about why. Computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. This is a good reson becuase we all have family. So I think that this is a good way to talk to them. An for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this. The reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right. Now on to more about using computer for homework. The reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework. This is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer. Now on to more about how computer are good to society. @CAPS2 @CAPS8 reson is because computer are good for fun stuff. Computer can have every game you want they have kid games, @CAPS2 @NUM1 year old sister goes on to the games that you can match. Teenagers can play games on the computer. The compter for me is cool because I can see how @CAPS2 football team is doing. Ho @CAPS2 @CAPS7 are doing. This is why the computer are good. These are @CAPS2 opion on this is that compter are used all the time peopl use them to talk to frend and family online. Peope also use computer for homework. Finally last and @CAPS8 reson is because you can use it for fun games for kids. An I can check how @CAPS2 teams are doing.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly sudjest that people should spend more time away from the computer. Instead they should be doing more exercise, doing more outdoor activity's, and most importantly spending more time with family and friend's. I think the best way to get everyone to agree with me is to write a passage to explain why I think that people should spend more time away from the computer. The most important reason why people should stop wasteing time on the computer is so that they could get more exercise. Getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are. More exercise could also be helpful because you could have health preventing you from getting deabetes, and a lot of people get diabetes from body in shape. My last reason why I say that getting more exercise is good for you is because, if you get more exercise then you would not have to worry about all of the deseas and problem's when you are in your elder ages. Another way you could spend your time instead of staying on the computer is by doing outdor activity's. Outdoor activitys could be really good for you because if you are not used to going outside and playing a nice game of football with you friends than it would be very fun for you. I remember one time when I first started going outside I had so much fun. My last reason why I say that more people should spend time doing more outdoor activitys is because of nature. It would be really good for you to go on a walk in a nice @DATE1 day to feel the breeze and smell all the nice scents. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family. Spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends. I remember one time when my cousin and I were at his house and we really did not know each other but I got to spend more time with him and now we know a lot about each other. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about you family. So now you know the three reason's why I say you could be doing more thing's instead of spending time on the computer which are exerciseing, doing outside activity's, and spending time with your family.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. Most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications People know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.

Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what its like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 make you to travel, travelling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer. It doesn't matter you using a computer for homework, talking with friends and familym or it is one of the most important inventions ever made.

Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers hold exclusive inofrmation, I do not believe the have a good effect on people. The majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body. Such as excersising or just going outside. People need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer. Not only will computers impact people, but it @MONTH1 also impact family in friends. There will be less interacting time a risk by going on a computer. Different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble. I firmly believe that computers have hamble affects on people. In @LOCATION1 today, we are already loaded with obese poeple. @NUM1 outof @NUM2 people are not physically healthy and a majority of obese people today state that they do own a computer. Computers attract people and same @MONTH1 sit at the computer for hours at a time what about excersising or enjoying the outdoors? Computers damage our bodies in a way by luering ourselves in while we can go out and enjoy nature. I definatly will argue this fact that computers have a bad effect on humans. Computer change not only the body, but mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom and I barely see her at all. She stays up there all the time, and when my mom calls for dinner, it takes more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from her computer. Computers affect people because they keep humans away from civilization. Friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person. It's disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers. This ruins many peoples social health, because the more they ignore their family or friends, these people will stop trying to interact with them. When these computer finatics came around, there want be anyone there for them. Computers definatly have an unhealthy affect on people who use them. How would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public. Nowadays, computers have a major chance to do that to you. Websites like @CAPS4, mysapce, or twitter have your information, and with a click of a button, it can be exposed to the world. Computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people. Some dont understand what they are doing and if bad info or a picture sends out, it can fully negatively impact your career or edecation. Computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet. Many agree, computers disadvantage many people in their own way. Whether it is by taking their health away because it keeps many indoors, or if it costs you your friends and family, computers are not good for your physical and social health. Computers can send out information and they are risky. They will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way.

The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. The others are either buying things or playing games. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. Everyday people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. The second choice should be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.

Did you know that computers are the number @NUM1 selling electronic device in the world? I think that computers are only making our soceity a smarter and more inteligent place. Also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch. Finnaly I think they are helping are society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likley hae a high paying carreer. Also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to casheer at a store all involve computers and to go those jobs you must know how to work a computer. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benifit our soceity. Secondly, I think that this price of technology benifits soceity because it keep family, friends and workers in touch. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living. Far away, @CAPS1 computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like @CAPS2, twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old time friends keep touch with the new video camera in the computer, family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours. Finnaly I think that computers benifit our soceity because they teach hand eye coordination other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time. All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by computers. Also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado anything but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benifit our soceity. So think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better.

Yes, I do think that we should continue useing computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance, and it also makes life simpler. First of all, computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world. Without computers we would not be able to @CAPS1 or evan video message other countries about important events. Sencond, we have to balance computers and excersing and interacting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by emailing or video chating can also help you stay in contact. Last useing computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an @CAPS1 and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and diffrent fonts just hand writing it. That why arents arent a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countres, they form a balance and it also makes life simplier.

Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are a neccessity to life. They benefit not only the community but the whole world! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet. Secondly, it's a form of communication. Also, computers can be fun and entertaining. As you know, education is one of the most important things in anyone's life. Where would we be without a computer to help? Think about how many times you've used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search something you didn't know the answer to. It's a lot, right? I do research everytime I get a random question jammed in my head. Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something. Another thing is there are online courses now for students. Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page. Also, how world students know what their homework is if they can't check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost everyday when I come home from school. It's great that the teachers care enough to post the homework. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in @LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, maybe even youtube, or just a simple e-mail, practically everyone has one. How else are yousupposed to talk to your friends after school? What do you expect us to do call them? Then wwwe would be on the phone for hours! Anybody with a teen at home knows that. Also, computers help deaf people talk. They just type in what they want to say and out it comes.I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program. Another reason is teachers and parents use e-mail to talk about academics and their children. Clearly communication is a must have. Therefore, computers are a benefit to society. There is no way that anybody over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game sometime in their life. Except, of course, if they don't have internet access. I know I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can't use the computer anymore. Woops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games. Oh come on like you haven't done that! Or at least your children have. Also, you can use specific programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business. In other words, computers are pleasurable. As you can see, computers are extremely educational. They provide search engines to figure out anything you're ever wanted to know about. Like, foreign places or movies. Anything. Also, we wouldn't have as much communication with people. How would we e-mail friends in @LOCATION3 without computers? Finally, you can find pleasure in computers. They are beneficial.

Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make computers can tech hand-ey coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. Fisrt off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could ba as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier that going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news stone you want details on. I took a survey and @NUM1 students say that they use thier computer every night so that they can read more into thier social studies or science unit, @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, chrildrens doctor states, "Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports" I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccser, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quiting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they would't have anyining to keep them fit one! that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers maens that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connectionds. Computers offer many sites such as facebook or myspace o connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or sype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you have at to in over a year? Don't you want some time them too? You can make time limts for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can took to all of your loved ones would you want to be the one crushing the oceans of a child that wants to talk/ see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when @CAPS6 sick so that @CAPS7 could cheer me up. Dont take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand-eye coordination and get to see my far friends and family.

Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around, second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and dont think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit, and healthy, we need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise! The next reason is that computers don't just have a bay effect on people, but our enveironment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people dont communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends, so we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to excercise more. Also, we need to help our environment. And lastly, we need to communcate better with friends and family. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.
<START>

More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.

Dear @PERSON1 the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention from some people around @LOCATION1 that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that people believe in the tecnology. So, the reason why I'm writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that are new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will effect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1 we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that its good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time is because @CAPS1 has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Sence all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gagits people really don't go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, "@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm." I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neigborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more offtine maybe @CAPS4 and adults too. will just do this naturally and will not have to relie on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea @PERSON1? My last topic is with computers and cellphone and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Now a days Friends aim, video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also is someone aims or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly I know familys that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their get off their emails and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a health relationship with family members. @PERSON1 I really hope I have persuade to you that technology is only ok to use sometime and not very day. Remember technology is bad because we don't exerce, play outside and enjoy nature and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time.

Dear I think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day out work or school. Not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when major legue baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can'@CAPS3 drive you to the library? This isn'@CAPS3 a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @NUM1's. You can check up on your local news, by having @NUM2's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. News isn'@CAPS3 the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the @DATE1's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping @PERCENT2 of internet users use sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from @NUM3 minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live-streaming @CAPS3.V, or that new @CAPS4 you got yesterday. That's right, @CAPS3.V's might not be needed soon! And what would a compter be without games? There are @NUM2's of @DATE1's of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that @PERSON1, @NUM5, was found through you tube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn'@CAPS3 attend proformances? Of couse, you tube isn'@CAPS3 the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wondering city streets, now you can just submit on aplication or have an interview without ever leaving your. Artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for have it be job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have them in your home. There's a erason that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all stay.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 of all I would like to say that I love your story and puzzels in your paper and I think I have a story you guys can use. It's about people that is addicted to computers. I guess you guys wondering about what I mean about addicition to computers. Well im going to give you three reason about this. My @CAPS1 reason is people isn't spending a lot of time with there family. I say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person thats addicted to the internet isn't doing want he/her is suppose to do. For example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off. Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have. I know people that's addicted to online chat rooms and I sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they don't know who there talking to! It could be anybody even a pedafile. My final reason is because some people just don't care. Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chating when they can be doing a essay or something helpful or caring. You know I use to addicted to the computer myself and because of that I almost failed all my classes and because of that I don't use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now I just read my email or write my essay. And that concludes my or should I say your next top story.

Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.

Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computer. This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.

Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is a easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has a email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reaqquainted with a old friends. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person recieving the email can reply when they howe free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word. Using a computer would aid you financialy. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isnt always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, your still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research connecting with friends, and your @CAPS3 easy! Use a computers @DATE1 and your life will be changed for the better.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the affects that computers have on kids. Computers lets kids do what they want and They dont have to travel far to see certin things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes. Its good if you want to see it in person but you wont want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace, @CAPS2, and games also its got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer. I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it. It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up. Computers are almost everywhere in phones, I-pods, and even some are put in car like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitials, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like radioshack. Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school. In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them. So i think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world to day so I disagree with what scientist or people say about computers and the affects it has on certin people of @DATE1.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature. Just like the expert then tinker siad in his book called @CAPS2 by computers "To much time on the computers and not the rackemed saven hours outsiad can make you very wnight." @CAPS3 @CAPS4 why people should get out more is @CAPS5 they can have coumite shion with friends and family. I bet you did not know that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are siting on thier cowth or play vite games as we. Another @CAPS4 is that people need more exercis. more the @NUM3 of the leading of the country will be abeast due litle exercise, and that is mostly because of computers.And the last @CAPS4, and the most importint as well, is @CAPS5 people can injoy nature at its fullist, blivie it or not but jack cup thinks @CAPS5 too he said '@PERCENT2 of people how injoy nature will @NUM4 years longer and people now not will likely have a heart in there @NUM5's" @CAPS5 that is why I think computers are bad for people but it is not just me it is @PERSON1, jackup @CAPS6, sisintsits, and many percentages as well.

Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.

@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now.

Computers are good for school uses, skills, and just for fun. Computers are a good source to have, now that is just my opinion. But, I think computers are mostly for pre-teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business. The fun uses that the computer provides are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet, @CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or downlosd music onto your ipod. @CAPS3 is a website teenagers of kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. Itunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, tv show, or movie onto and ipod. Computers also provide microsoft @CAPS5, publicher, powerpoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposs. @CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a @NUM1 page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school of you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc. publisher alloews you to make them. Powerpoint is a program where you can make different slides in anything. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs @MONTH1 need the computer to comunicate with others. Computer, I think, are a big help in the world.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are direclly cetered to developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video! Even most they are not physically with you talk to. Instan messaging is a less direct, but still useful who talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as facebook, and twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can past messages, play games or simply talk to someone on these websites. They certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do. Also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills. These could possibly cary over into the situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something. Also online games are for and enjoying also. Overall I believe the computer is a valuable resource in advertion, interacting with other people and playing useful games. After all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life?

Do you love technology? More and more people in this world are using so much technology and especialy computers. But not everyone agrees that this benefit society. But I do. Because it can glue people the ability to learn about anything they want to learn. Then it can give a better communication to others that lives farther away from you. My last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country. Now I agree that computers can be useful man made sorce. When I was about @NUM1 years old I loved to play on the computer I thought that this was just a game. But my dad told me that do not abuce the computer, use it for education. I found out that theres so many things to teech about just a click of a botton. Now you can use this technology as a tool not a game. You might not want to go to the library to find a book you can just look it up in the computer. People love to talk to others, to meat new people or just comunicate to others who live in a other country. One of the best ways are on the computer. I am @NUM2 years old and I have alot of friends that chat on the computer, and I am one of them. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I just can't catch, a plane every day to go visit them. So I just go on the computer and talk to them it's one of the fastest ways and fun ways to. The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the strongest @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would not believe the technology they have and how they use them. One of the best things they have is the "@PERSON1." @CAPS1 a plane drivin by a remote control. It's just like a fighter plane but without a pilot! The person controling it can relax in bace wile the @PERSON1 does all the work now come and join me to say that computers are useful in this world! From the reasons above, I state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want. It gives' a way to comunicate. Last @CAPS1 a good way to protect this country. Technology is growing faster by the minute and strogger. So take my word "don't abuse it, use it."

To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.

Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.

Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.

I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself "she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?". I said to my mom "I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all." I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, "no"... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.

Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, local paper @CAPS2 @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. Computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. Help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species call the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computer help society learn about all this. Computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @CAPS14 is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. You can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @CAPS14. @CAPS14's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This how computer help people talk with others around the world. This how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local newspaper.

Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lifes, & having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, & sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, & family a whole lot happier.

Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 you might heard on the @ORGANIZATION1 new, more and more people thing computers are the benefits of society. I personally agree with them. I think that theyare making people missing out of new things, missing out of meeting new people, and looking out on exercize. Time flys by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever ben on a computer for an hour. It might have felt you were on for @NUM1 minets. Many people ben on it for a hole day. You could of missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camra be invend and you would of not known. Also, the ipod. You could down load books andd read them on there. There also new things to try like jumping art of a plain or bungy jumpimg. You could be going to new place around the world. Traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even under water. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right of the oven tayst cheese pizza. My mouth is grulling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know. What about on facebook or myspace. @CAPS3 not you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. Thats they learn how to share @CAPS2, your not two anymore but its good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You @MONTH1 think your way in good and the other erson way is not. Thats called interacting talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on news how many familys have someone in the familys having weight problems. Meny shows like biggest losers @CAPS3 it chanels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what cams this? It could be not eating right, or not excresing right. But the problem could do with computers. Many people are spending @NUM2 mins on the computer, than @NUM3 excersising. Just a quick walk around the lock can make you lose at leat @NUM4 callories. Other might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 callories. And some deaths are around by a heart attack. This @MONTH1 caused by plack billed up or weight going. In sted of reaching for an apple many americans reach for that foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the rtimes we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter. Thinking people wont lisen about excersing and meeting new people or palces. But, the one thing we can do is to at least insire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card. Now we havethin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with deatails. Technology is like a train are you going to live it.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do not benefit society. They do more bad than good in my opinion. People aren't on the computer to research people. They are on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. Humans that have to much on time on their hands. So their bored maybe they will make a @CAPS3 account or if they already have on then they will maybe one of the games on their and eventually you get addicted to @CAPS3 and you never go off of it. Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3. If you want to really have a great life sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. Ya need to live your life like your going to die tommorow. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation get away with your family. Travel the world and rember every part of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? We need to inform our state about this problem. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries! People are not leaving their house and not getting active. If people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before.

School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said "you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic." @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents. They aren't always for just helping. Computers can also be used for amusement. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? You also use the computer to do work. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something. Information on anything is always on the internet. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more. Back then people used computers mostly for work. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things.

Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing "@CAPS1" or "@CAPS2" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are "chatting" or "@CAPS4'ing" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for "fun." @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad.

Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably waisting a full day on those facebook, myspace gol websites, looking up diffenitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eye-site, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer. Staring at that @NUM2 inch little screen can damage your eye-site. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind. How would your life be without not talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waist your time on those websites for example: facebook all you @CAPS3 is instant message the person. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 something fun with that person. What's this I hear about map it.com? Don't be lazy and waist @NUM3 minutes at your day just getting directions. Use a a real map! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 have a "great effect"on people. It gives them short cuts through life.

Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I use to spend three hours online everyday. I did not get any exersice at all. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietbeaties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost alot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on colledge and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life. Computers incourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank acounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate by the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low life scums and criminals. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world.

Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great.

Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 computers are useful they have a negative affect on people. Due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore. People are so busy with computers that they dont even spend quality time with their friends and family anymore. Obesity is also a big issue. Computers are ruining peoples expierence with the great outdoors. Many peope, mostly kids stay inside all day playing video games on computers. Outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports. Computers are just taking away from kids and now they dont get to expierence the fresh outside fun and are now a days kids in the @DATE1 stay inside all day, instead of going to fun outside camps. Families now a days are being broken up due to computers. The parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers. As a result the family starts to lose the bond between each other familys can also develop these ways, youth most likely get attracted to computers, so its either the son or daughter who are not emotionally or physically contacting with the family which is a problem. Health is a big issue when it comes to computers. Whats happening is teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer playing these games or surfin the web then eating dinner then continueing to surf the web or play the games. After time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy. This is a problem all over america, that is technology keeps advancing and advancing the youth will become very unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative affect on people. People are not going outside as much anymore. Families relationships are being ruined and peoples health is at steak! If this does not change americas future will be at risk.

some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers. People all over use computers to research other places computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled "@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1", then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and when, where and earthquake on the richter scale. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide. now matter if its for info, news, or to make thing neates.

Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home.

Dear @CAPS1, I dont think that computers are something that people should be using @NUM1. Computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive. From the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselfs so they look like a @NUM2 year old boy when there really a year old man. Lastly, people now a days are using the computer as a sorce of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either wacth to much @CAPS2, or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start with the computer you'll never stop. Especially if your multi-tasking where you eat and use the computer. The big problem is people think it's better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature exercising! It really isn't good that people dont get of the computer and start enjoying life. Next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There can be men who say there and really be @NUM3. With all the posting of pictures someone you with it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. I think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them.

Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative effect on people. The valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced, you will not see your family enough and some of the costs are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle. Clicking a mouse & typing away are only moving your hands, not your whole body. An individual who doesn't use the computer daily, or f or large amounts of time would be healthier than someone who always uses the computer. I remember seeing a commercial about @NUM1 children & how their lives eneded up later on in life just by their computer usage as a "tween." Not only will you be unhealthy but anti-socialism is probable too. Many kids, or even adults, spend precious family time playing the sims @NUM2 creating their own ideal family. This however, is not acceptable. Spending time with your family is something precious. When asked about computer usage, @PERSON1 said, "you could easily became addicted with just @NUM2 turns!" @CAPS1 you are addicted, both your family & you suffer. They will stop inviting you places. You wouldn't want to loose the people who are going to be ther for you, on another what. "@CAPS2!" shouts your computer. You have another virus. uh oh, it's deleting your hardware: all your scholastic essays, important book-marked websites & sentimental photographs. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data? Well, it'd be alot. I know youre probably thinking, "This couldn't happen to me," but in reality; yes it can storing things on a computer is much riskier than having a hard copy. It will also save you more money. Furthermore, appliances use electricity @CAPS1 they're even plugged into an outlet! So when you get your electric bill, don't be surprised, computers can be very costly which, is why it's not worth it to have one. Computers are just another unnecessary thing in life. It will take away from your over-all health, reduce family time, & cost you same big bucks. It is a fact that you can survive without a computer. But without hjealth? Well, you'd be dead. I you to consider my ideas.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 "Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that "@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed". Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are bad for society. It came to my attention that many people are concerned that computers are not very good in my opinion I think computers are They help typeing skills. Computers are also very helpful with and crofing pictures, and they make it to find information. First of all, computer are very helpful with typing skills. Other people doesn't use computers takes six years to @CAPS3 younger people like young skills use very quickly. Actuly @PERCENT1 of teens can type in a minutes Who takes @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great effect on many people with their typeing skills. Computers makes it so copier with so many pictures editing and many more, editing pictures from a expensive digital @CAPS2 it for free on your computer? A computers makes it and it through a lack of information to just computer and find it faster. The computer you can look for information make faster. For example you have to @CAPS2 a project on @CAPS4. Instead of going to the library and spending more on a book about @CAPS4 you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. So much information and so much faster. Get with the program computers are in. In conclusion, I think computers is a great invention. They make it easier to find information and typing skills. Also they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos, please take my suggestions sereusly.

Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think oposite though. I think this way because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. Some jobs you have to apply by computer. Another thing is a computer allows you to talk online with other people. The first reason why I think using a computer is good for people is because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. What I mean by this is you might have to look up a job, you might want to get away so you look up vactions that you can take or you might have to pay a bill one day. The second reason why I think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply by computer. Such as stop and shop, price right, and save-alot. To add on to that this is good for are society because if we use paper thats killing more trees. The third reason why I think using a computer is a good because this allows you to talk online with other people. Therefore you @MONTH1 need to contact a family member or even an old friend, meet new people or you might not like to talk on the fone, so you rather talk by computer. Now I told you all the reasons why I think using a computer is good. @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer, some jobs you have to apply by computer, lastly allows you to talk online with other people. These are some good pros. So I hope you take my opinion in consideration.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I want to tell you why I'm a little bit against computers theres a lot of things you can do in the world, visit places, and go on cruise ships. First I would like to tell about the things you can do you can play basketball, handball, hang with your friends. Also you take your car and go out into a morning drive feel the breeze. Next I would like to tell you about the places you can visit, you can visit your friends house your girl/boy friend your family just do that stop being lazy computers aint helping you with your life stop being lazy. Finally I would like to tell you about the cruise ships you can go far away like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many more. Its fun on a cruise ship captains dinner and meet @ORGANIZATION1 people and @ORGANIZATION1 sights. For conclusion I would say people should stop being lazy on computers and have fun in the world while it lasted.

Dear Local Newspaper, I beleive, myself if, that computers are extreemly important to our society in this day and age. Computers help people talk with people. Online, and keep in touch with family and friends. Secondly, I think that computers are important is because they help with learning, even online schooling. Lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. Computers help them keep in touch, wheather it's by e-mailing them, or even video chat. This makes people happy, and still keeps them informed about what their family members, or friends are up to. For some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching, I don't know, maybey their long-lost brother, or something. Computers keep families togetherm and you might just got a little surprise every now and again! My we should keep computers because we. Lastly, computers can just be plain fun! Maybe you're looking for some funny videos, just go on and search,"funny videos", and it will keep you busy for a while. I know that I enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? If there is a song going through your head, just look it up and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You @MONTH1 be cooking and need a recipie for something, I am sure you're computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. All right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today. We depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and provide entertainment, just to name a few. Computers can help with countless things.

I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy.

Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside. In my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot. It's @CAPS1 to use the computer to chat with freinds, search some stuff you never seen. I say this because some people get addicted to computer games, or talking to your freinds the whole day. Next reason is to go outside, you can enjoy more stuff like sports, tag, and other activities. Instead of talking to a freind on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house. Another reason why I the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things. I hope you have found my interduction good and reading on. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer fetures. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer, it's @CAPS1 to go on it some time's but not to much. It is better to go outside you got fresh air its nice and cold. If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your freinds. My next reason is going outside playing sports or running alround playing tag. Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something. It's better to learn stuff in real life than in computer's. Your dad can teach you how stick bricks together to make a chimny, or on how to use a lawn mower to cut other peoples yard's to make money.

Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, "yo sup man," "not, you" "not much, just fiding around for some exercise" "same here, same here" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends.

Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail. Now I hope you like the reasons I wrote on why computers are good to have.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks "nerds" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, "@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise." This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health.

I think computers have a postitive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with Your Family and friends either in @CAPS1 chat or @CAPS2. Computer are also helpful for applying for @CAPS3 like you can look for @CAPS3 you like. You can do @CAPS5 exciseses and useful for @CAPS5 essays. If you have a laptop you can bring it anywhere you want you don't have connect anything it take wireless and you can connect to the @CAPS6. You can look up stuff on the @CAPS6 for your homework and other stuff. Buy things without having to go to the store. These are reasons why computers have a postitive affect on people.

Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make comunication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know whats going on outside of the office. There, are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great pendmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of ouside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abrevations for words and phrases, such as "idk" for "i dont know". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can do also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable.

Computers are an amazing technology to life. It'@CAPS1 amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. Also the jobs it helps us the police, @CAPS1.W.A.T and the @ORGANIZATION1. It helps the police and @CAPS1.W.A.T to find where people are and where they'll be. The @ORGANIZATION1 uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend. if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't of found @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that wont get off their computers. They are obssesed with the computer and they are so obssesed they sleep with the computer. That'@CAPS1 the parents fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat an lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. The computer controlls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret-files, satalites, all of @CAPS5.A.@CAPS1.A. and more. They control life in the major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it'@CAPS1 the person'@CAPS1 fault, they ruined their lifes and the parent'@CAPS1 fault manly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruines their life by having no friends at school an all they do is go straight for the computer. It'@CAPS1 an ashame to the father that use to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son an relises his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tryes to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, thats good parenting to try to step it right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good an bad ideas.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand-eye coordination they're convient and you can interact online with diffrent types of people. Surely, computers teach hand-eye coordination. There are many website on the internet that teach kids to type. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you. Last, there are many kids even adults who have disiexing and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computer teach hand-eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computer are convient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of button. Next, theres no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research just research online for free. Finally, it is convinient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via-email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples. Computer are convient in many ways. Computers allow people @NUM1 video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computer allow families to see each other online. Without ever leaving their state. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other on line. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand eye coordination. They supply online chat, and are very convient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home do the same online.

I belive having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think.

Dear editor, computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff.

Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shoudn't spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shoudn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get your self out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, The average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily! People spend too much time on their computers. They don't exercise as much nowadays. Also, they don't enjoy all the wonderful nature the has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't see their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer. Since people spend too much time on the computer, the exercise less and less. A recent poll shwos that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers than maybe people would be bore & maybe fo outside. Back in @DATE5 only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why in @DATE6 has this number skyrocketted to @PERCENT1? Back then electronics weren't popular so for fun, kids played games with eachother outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kids to be motivated to put down the mouse, and go play kickball with neighborhood) friends. The kids would rather sit inside a airconditioned hoose thatn go outside & have some good healthy fun & work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative. With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, or the waves crashing on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1. They don't take time to appreciate has beautiful the follage is in @DATE2, or now it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours doing wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joy. Computers run people's relationships with family and friend. @NUM5 year old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spen time with this @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities we enough. as it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. Peple have accounts on social networking sites like facebook and sometimes they are very drame filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthyness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of naturel, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. The cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computer have a negative affect on people.

When your were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well my parents don't let me and I think thats not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye cordination. Another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams. Also with a computer you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course when your on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or t.v show, like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult @CAPS5 pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home, well when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting like through the webcam or my favorite @CAPS6 which stands for aol instant messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way your an adult who didn't go to college when you were @NUM1 because you had to work well. If you have a computer or laptop you can go to school online and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you thinkg that is a nice way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1? When your a kid my age when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well that is what must of us kids do nowadays but our parents don't let us play to much. The only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school. But when your a kid besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that's what you. Most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel. Of course that what my parents do, everytime a vacation they look everything online like the hotel, the, and the. yes having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because everytime I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1 the time goes by so quick that a @NUM2 hour flight only seems like @NUM3 hours. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do alot of school work with it like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing.

Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people. Thanks to computers the time is now to accet @CAPS2 people should have computers to use to lern about the @CAPS5 or just think what everyone sayes. So I hope you make a good chouse. But befor you choose think about it.

Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the compter was a smart idea,! But why do you ask,? i'll show you. This device can teach you a new language, skype can let you talk to @CAPS1 on the web or on phone!, (but you still have to pay @MONEY1.) you can surf the web or have a laugh on youtube, who needs to go out and buy stuff when on ebay or amazon just order and your done, (but you still have to wait.) why go to blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like, no late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store, no more of that please!. Next lets go back to the web, @CAPS2 you own a @CAPS3 or a built in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video chat with @CAPS1 and family across the globe!, @CAPS2 you'r the kind of person that like video games then boy you will love this!, @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's can download games such as sim's, spore, etc. then you will love the @CAPS6. MACs also share good stuff such as the finder, safari, dashboard, etc, so thats all i have to say about @CAPS8. And now you are probably asking which computer should i get?, @CAPS9 @CAPS12 friend's at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 you have the abillty to choose either @CAPS8 or @CAPS6, but it's not @CAPS12 disision to pick out your computer, it's yours so go out and create an investment for a computer today!. but im not finished yet you can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook I can tell about all of them and I will, a laptop is good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot and @CAPS2 your in the office or you have a lot of business trips its a good idea th have a laptop at hand,. a desktop is good @CAPS2 your home a lot and work is oniline on the web or just llike the comfort of home than a desktop is right for you!, and last but not least, the netbook, it's good @CAPS2 your on the go a lot especialy when yory on vacation, and it fits nicely on your lap or on a table or @CAPS2 you dont want to get up to use the computer just grab your netbook and your ready to go, I almost forgot all netbooks come with a built in @CAPS3 so @CAPS2 your on vacation and you dont have a phone or computer just go on your netbook and there you go. well thats all I have to say thanks for reading

One person can learn so much with a computer. You can buy and sell a iturn that you own an get many all on one web site. A computer can be used for many difrent perpests.

Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect.

Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and no interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can sey time limits on the computer if they think your. Spending to much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certin time they go on and off of the computer. For example a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automaticaly. That way your child can't get back on till thier next time. The computer can do many things you can play online games and chat with friends. Chating will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example an online game can let you chat make friends,

@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours. These magnetic forces keep people from exercising, stops them from spending time with family and friends and most importantly if they aren't being careful they can get into some cyber danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2 and he said @CAPS3 are so many people on their computers, people aren't getting enough exercise!" @CAPS4 people dont get enough exercise their bodies expand and become obese. This happens a lot to average people. The @CAPS2 and I thought up some great ideas while I was @CAPS3 and we think for one week in @DATE1 we are going to live without any electricity! Computers are very use-full, they help spread important information around fast and make it easy to talk to friends and family. Even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills. Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person. Usually you would type "u" instead of "you" or "r" instead of "are". Talking over the computer is great!" says @PERSON1, "But actually seeing my family and talking talking to them is way better." @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and way more sights websites can put you in cyber danger! Cyber danger is @CAPS4 you get in trouble on the computer. This can happen @CAPS4 you put up bad pictures of yourself or other people, @CAPS4 you talk to someone you have never met before, or you say something really mean to that girl you don't like. Those situations can all put you in a really tough place. Even if you have a webpage and you put it on private @CAPS3 is always a way to get in. @CAPS3 is also something called cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is @CAPS4 you get bullyed or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know @CAPS3 are ways to track down coversations between people. I really hope you all take this into account @CAPS4 you think about sitting at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be careful from cyber danger! "@NUM1" bye!"

Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. In conclusion I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.

Dear @CAPS1 local @CAPS2, I think that computers are on positive effect on people. @CAPS6 you think that there positive on people? Well I'll give you @NUM1 reasons why you should say "@CAPS8" @NUM2) teaches hand-eye coordination @NUM3) abiliy to learn and get your @CAPS3 online @NUM1) you can talk to people all of the world. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. @CAPS1 first reason is hand-eye coordination. If you have hand-eye coordination, you can @CAPS6 anything. This can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. Having hand-eye coordination is important because were in @DATE1 everything goes around by computer and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason. @CAPS1 second reason, how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your @CAPS3 online. And you can take online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop-out rate and @PERCENT2 of those kid don't have there @CAPS3, so they go online to take there classes. The computer can really help you. This is @CAPS1 second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and met new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to @CAPS6. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chats rooms are cool to. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasteding your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. @CAPS1 last reason. OK, I'm done but @CAPS6 you remember that question I asked you? (@CAPS6 you the computers are a positive effect on people?) @CAPS7 @CAPS6 you think? I hope you say " @CAPS8, they are an positive effect ". But any ways those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!!

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 everybody relizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day. That is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like @CAPS19, getting an answer to a problem, and @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 work. The more advanced Computers become, the more advanced People are. To start, Computers can help People comunicate just imagine someone on the other side of the world. you can use websites like @CAPS3 and e-mail to quickly comunicate with typing. I @CAPS4 like @ORGANIZATION2 can quickley send live videos of yourself all the way across the world . Without these technologies, we would never see each others faces and we would only be useung telephones. with @CAPS5 book, you can also @CAPS6 @CAPS7 like never before. Have you ever been in the situation when you can'@CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS7? well I have @CAPS7 can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes. It used to be that @CAPS10 traveled very slowly, @CAPS8, we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened, thanks to computers. Computers can relay information at practily the speed of light. It is also a lot easier to find the @CAPS10. You only need to @CAPS9 the mouse a few @CAPS18 and you find the biggest resivior of @CAPS10 ever. Their is international @CAPS10, @CAPS11 @CAPS10, and much more in the palm of your hand. @CAPS10 also travels @CAPS12 on the internet then on @CAPS10 @CAPS14 or @CAPS15.V. Their are also on line @CAPS10 @CAPS14 like the @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18 and magazines like time. Have you ever felt sick, and you didn'@CAPS15 want to leave your house? Well how you ran do all your @CAPS19 on line. Their is no more going to a store to buy furniture or clothes you can just log on to a computer and have almost every store on your finger tips. Buy a whole @CAPS16 @CAPS20, a @CAPS16 couch, and even your groceries in only ten minutes. You can even shop for houses or cars online. @CAPS19 on the internet has truly changed the world in more ways the anyone could have belived fifteen years ago. To @CAPS21, computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one. @CAPS1 Computers get smarter, maybe they can also do incredible things like work for us and automaticly buy something for us if we are running out of @CAPS22. The @CAPS23 are endless.

Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much. In my opinion, i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, you will be more active. Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you cansee, there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side, going kout to eat, as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions means something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 not advance in technology?" asks four year old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people arent excersicing, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic excersize for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. "@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cutdown as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speach. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to kid message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature & the rain forest? "@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are loosing their homes. When a pool was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to ejoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet." I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner," sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed what he wished that he could change about his life, he answerd, "I wish that I didn't use the computers as much I got to know @CAPS3 family & friends better! @ORGANIZATION3 died lates that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel love by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were to busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones' in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are aweful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family & nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?"

Computers are very helpful in many of ways. I believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you. @CAPS5 can cause you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and cheap @CAPS3. The computer can @CAPS1 you in many interesting ways. The fast wat @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 helping other plan @CAPS4 vacations by money to them. Also @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 by know how to do diffrent things like @CAPS6 if you get lost or show you how to get there. The second way is helps is to give @CAPS2. The computer can give you plenty of @CAPS2. I use the computer @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS7 of . @CAPS5 also gives me @CAPS2 about a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and like to attend to. The last way the computer helps out the its with box from there. If you @CAPS10 online you can in the computer. I @CAPS9 this machine because you don't have to buy something that just come out @CAPS4 the real expensive @CAPS12 you can just @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 @CAPS5 @CAPS4 a cheaper @CAPS12. Also @CAPS13 mom wanter to @CAPS11 new @CAPS15 on the dealer but @CAPS5 was expensive so went online and bought @CAPS5 cheaPer than the would sell @CAPS5 to us. This is how the computer can come in handy when you need @CAPS5. This is why I believe that computer you.

Dear, Local @ORGANIZATION1 paper I do think that computers benefit society, because if a student needs to write a report europe their going to weell. A computer to give the quier accesible information is do there project at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you stay social and not. They also teach hand-eye-cordination. So you eyes are beter their seeing nothing. I also think computer benifits society because it could get student motivated in passing there test or passing the school year and getting the to use it. Computers are also a great of knowledge and can get kids to be better on a subject like history, or science, you should agree with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers got there information off the internet sometimes and with our computers @ORGANIZATION1 would be slow and. Computers also have positive effects on people because it teaches them the dangers of things and they could be more and, and computers give finger strongly gripto be a lot faster, and computers are the fastes way to know about the @ORGANIZATION1 or about the wether, like if there wits going to be a snow storm you could check if you got school.

Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a responce. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, I go on the computer once or twice a week. i dont use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself." @CAPS2 people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The @CAPS2 movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't relesase many endorphins, so they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy . Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family."

@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all @MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in @MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They aren’t getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance @MONEY1 computer use.

Dear local news paper, Computers are powerful machines in our world. Most people east, sleep, and drink computer. Thats when those people are forty and live with there mom, for the most part of computer are used by teenagers and buiness workers. Computers are a tool that need to be used in an everyday life. We all know and remembe when we were "sick" just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings drank coffee, and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could of been making spread sheet, designing logos, editing someones or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. they need to be senting work to other companies over sea's or just down one float. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in @LOCATION1. Also the computers in today's time are beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows use to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the close bridle shop, the biggest shopping mall, biggest race car tract near you and pizza placer near you. The inernet can let you do many things. I know that hear in granby you have to but the newspaper, but instead of but the paper you can just go on you computer and chechk the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv. and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced chanles to watch movies. You can see you favorite shows and moves. A big thing is that teenagers span a majority of there time on facebook, twitter or myspace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food. Thats why the computer

My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. "But" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary.

When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, and other chat live oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is oovoo & online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just callem'up. When I think of facebook or oovoo, or even myspace it makes me think of inapropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very unhumane and that is very dangerous to post ot because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the @DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to see your @CAPS3 that lives across the country? Well computers can do that. Ther re positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letteing people communicate with family or friends from across the world or letting everything be easy to find what they @CAPS4 many people are people isolate and keeping them from talking to family / friends I is helping them by being to chat or type to them. People can now talk to reltives in the comfort of thre home without having to about how they look. Computer also phone bills because of call your mom in @LOCATION1 just go on I chat and chat with her, it's just @CAPS5 you can see the computers Some people also think computers give people to much access to but ther it give people the of know what they This is good for school to for look for In my fall @NUM1. or people @CAPS6 you can see computers let you find the information you the time has that @CAPS7 computers without or keeping people away from family

@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example people who use the computer constently spend less time doing anything else in general. Also the longer you stay on the more you use it, and this habit forms a addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives. Maybe their going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientest have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a addiction. In fact if we could scan people to find addiction @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3, I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientest tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I that you don't want to see you or your kids brillant brains turned to mush by computers.

The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?

Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer.

Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on wether computers benifit soscity is greatly debated but to me the answer is odvious. The internet is an extreamly useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxay most people have. The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company. Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store. I know thats useful for those parents, like many that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication. These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only. These are websights like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that mant teachers would be torn apart without the compluter. Lastly, one of the most important issues. The downsides of the internet. Even though myspace and facebook are ment for good they also have a dark side.

Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family.

Dear Readers, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture. I don't think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out. Everyday when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there, I log into @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. And my exersize in the next @NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers. My point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside. Statisctis show that @NUM2 kids spend more time inside year-round than out these days. "@CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @NUM3 years." says @PERSON1 a pediatrician in @LOCATION1, "they all need thier exersize." @CAPS1 is cutrogeous how much people are on computers now, @CAPS1 starts to affect thier attitude, and control thier lives. Sometimes checking notifications on @CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with thier family or friends. A mom of @NUM4 teens says "They all go to thier rooms, shut thier doors and go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS6 untill dinner and after, they go right back." In this case, they just plug into thier computers and forget about everyone else. I think @CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers. 1/@NUM4 mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You @MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen-pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking your friends, but its not the same as being with them. On my recent trip to @LOCATION2 to go skiing, I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you're with her and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out. Also @NUM6 arguments now, have something to do with a missunderstanding through the computer, people @MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @CAPS1 the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around.

Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.

Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are everything, They provide with so many things for you to do like chess, listening to music, and even downloading you favorite movies. First of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in @LOCATION1 then you can talk to them online. You can do this through via email. Instant message, and @CAPS1. Secondly, Computers let you search the web. So if you need to findout some directions to your destination or want to get informaion on some far awat places like @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, or my favorite @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can because the web lets you do that. Thirdly, they are a great source of entertainment. Well because you can watch episodes of your favorite @CAPS4.V. show or you can watch music videos. Also you @MONTH1 enjoy listening to music from your computer as you personal entertainment. I think that computers are great. I use them myself as an example I love to download music into my ipod from my computer. Then I get to enjoy the music from my ipod. Last, but not least, @CAPS5 computers have a great effect on a majority of people. I believe that if we didn'@CAPS4 have computers then our world wouldn'@CAPS4 be the same. So I say keep computers here to stay. They complete us all.
<START>

I think that computers have a bad effect on people. I think that because of many reasons and I will tell you some of these reasons. One reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day, you will only get worse. Say if you were @NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit. Then if you have no exersize then you will get bigger and bigger. Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace. Then there is some kind of diesese that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times. Your dont want to do that because if you dont use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football, baseball, or any other kind of around some place. Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand. My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. If you do that then mabe your computer will lost everything on it. Then you have to get a new computer and everything all. If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it. The information then they like how. And if you dont know person you dont know what they can do. So I hope you dont buy something that has a really bad virus else like that. Those would be all reasons on why you shouldnt go on the computer to much and why it does not really help other then when you are doing research or any other kind of work or job related way.

@ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spendign too mcuh time on computers affects your activity level. Also. Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. "A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers."

In my opinion computer ars benefit with the socient here are my s reasons, I can talk wit my friends, I can do my homework, or I can do olner things in the computer to. First reasons, I can talk with my friends or I can talk with my family on facebook or myspace o his on msn or I can se my family in the camera msn the camera is allot of help with me because lik my family is in @LOCATION1 I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or going visiting to @LOCATION1. Next reasons, I can do my homework on I can write a big letter on I can do a lot of work in the computer is and easy. Final reason I can do a lot of things like find a question or do project on.

Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people @CAPS3 days don’t get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 tax payers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computers all of the time and thier are many people who have completely cut themselves off frfom their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent pursuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise. More ofen in order to stay healthy. As technology to affect our lives, we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition to people not people dont enjoy life as much, You only live once and life is special, so why sitting all day? I many anymore because they spend all of there @CAPS3 are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers. need to be and I can tell you that you life will not being you in enjoyable luife. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people when people got to Too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate to people, they should not be the anly thing you use to talk to friends and family. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead on-healthy lives because our priorities on health are why to low. They also keep you from enjoying life, to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have pursuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computers, think of all the things you are missing out in life!

Dear, Newspaper In my mind the computer benifits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, computers help us with education, and the heath/safty purposes are fantastic. People love entertainment. Computers are very fun. At electronic stores computer games are sold. These games are usally good. Instead of having games that are bad for the brain most compuer games are not. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 says @CAPS3 is very entertaining but is not brain damaging. Everyone loves watching @CAPS1.V. On computers people can now watch @CAPS1.V. Not only is that entertaining but @CAPS3 will save money because you don'@CAPS1 need a @CAPS1.v. Now people can insteadly down load @CAPS1.v. shows and movies on thier computer. @PERSON1 just got a new computer for his birthday last week. "@CAPS3 is so fun watching @CAPS1.v. on my computer and @CAPS3 is so easy." @CAPS4 explained. Learning from @PERSON1 I hope you can learn how entertaning computers are. At school we use computers all the time. If we did not have computers we would not learn the same. On his new computer @PERSON1 can do all his projects and homework on @CAPS3. Before @CAPS4 had his computer @CAPS4 had to write out all his papers and when @CAPS4 finished @CAPS4 spent to long writing that @CAPS4 could not do his rest of homework. Now @CAPS4 can not type @CAPS3 out, and still do all his other homework. If you think that amazing then read this. Research done by @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERCENT1 of kids with computer are smarter than before they had thier computers. "I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer." @PERSON1 says. I hope people can now be like @PERSON1 and buy computers. Do you want to have a smarter world? Computers open up an all news heath and safty field. You @MONTH1 learn a little about geneitics. @CAPS3 would have took about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of the genes of we did not have computers. All the information scientists have learned from the human geno project can cure cancer and other dieseases. Computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe. New technology can track kids. If an unfortunet event happens an your kid is missing then a computer can help to find him. A new mother lost her kid last @DATE1 while eating lunch at a park. She knew she had a chip in the childs body. She opened her laptop and found where her kid was. Amazing right. I hope everyone can have a computer for heath and safty reasons. I hope you can now see that computers benifit the society from heath and safty to education in school. Without computers we could not be where we are today.

Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society. Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still. Computer have also ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that having a computer is a very positive. I know that teenagers are on the computer a lot, but if it really bother the parents, why do they have computers in their houses? @CAPS3, I can tell you @NUM1 reason why. They are good sources of information, its a good way to talk with your friends and it gives you information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to say that computer are a fantastic source of information. They can tell you anything! This is also helpful because if you are working on a project, and your mom cant you to get books at library, then there you go! A computer is just a simpler way to look up information. Did you know, that @PERCENT1 of parents who got their family a computer do not regret their desicion? Thats almost all the parents in @LOCATION2! @CAPS6 as you can see, it would help kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers today use computers to talk with our friends @ORGANIZATION1 email @CAPS3, I think this is alot better than sending @CAPS4! Why would you wait letter from your cousin @LOCATION1. When you can talk to them in seconds! And it do paper if you just @CAPS5 to buy I would like to say that having like this one time, I was work my we were looking for a hotel to stay in when we went to we ended up finding a great hotel, for a cheap You can also go on map guest if you @CAPS5 to someone. @CAPS6 for all the people out there who dont computers are important have would you to In conclusion, I think that having a computeer is a very important thing for @NUM1 reson they are very good book source they help us communicate with friends and for every information on for @CAPS6 imleaving the opinion with you hopefully you will learn something than better and pick the right

Almost every family has access to a computer. They have become a part of life and a way to be a part of life outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement. Overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, @NUM1 students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on sites such as A.I.M.(@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to talk in friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @CAPS6. And say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component computers. Adds from @ORGANIZATION3 show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement I see no direct harm from computers.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has proven that @NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @LOCATION4 as well as @CAPS2 they have recently traveled to. Also @PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day @CAPS4, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about @LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer.

Dear local newspaper, I think your wrong!!. I totally disagree with this letter. People need computers to do research. Also helps us keep in contact with others. Another thing is @CAPS1 can get anything needed. First, @CAPS1 need computer. @CAPS1 need computer to help us with research. Instead of picking up a book you can go online. It's faster and easier. Also, You can look up information on any place or any project and it will help you. Thats the graet thing the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has any information. Next, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also used for keeping in contact. For example, instant messaging. Also you can chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even go in chat room. But just keep in mind know who you're talking to because it might be a stranger. Anyways you can use the internet @CAPS7 an easy way to talk to people or to "keep in contact". Lastly, @CAPS7 you know the internet is used for research and talking but also for getting anything you want. You can go online and get pictures, games, videos, music or even directions to a place. Also the internet is used to just have fun. I use it mostly for ypoutube, @CAPS5, and for googling pictures. You can look up basicly any thing on line and it will most likely be there for you. In conclusion, the web is used for researching. Also for chatting. Finally for basicly anything you want it for. That is why @CAPS1 should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside to. But maybe people should cutback a little on @CAPS8.V. Now do you see why I chose this side? Maybe in the future there will be a way to go on the computer but be active to.

Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people "skype" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new "social networking series" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways.

I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. Computers are an exelent way to comunicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, and even facebook. It’s the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if I send them an @CAPS1-mail it’s cheaper. Studys from the university of @LOCATION1 show that @PERCENT1 people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. More over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. Another thing computers are used I for as learning. Many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. Maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. Without computers the coustemers couldn’t learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. With out computer scientests couldn’t do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @LOCATION2 and everything. Doctors wouldn’t be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. They learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @PERSON2 said she couldn’t be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. Builder and modern desiner @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today. I hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you think is the best technology made so far? Computer! They are the best technology because you can do anything on the computer. My friends say computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best technology because the internet can help a lot @ORGANIZATION1 things like if you have research paper. Research has proven that computers are a positive effect on people. My mom says computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the most hardiest tools in the world. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are one @ORGANIZATION1 the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments. They say that for people to talk online with other people. They said that they can interact with family members who live far away. They also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens @ORGANIZATION1 the streets and in their homes. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand-eye cordination. Another thing he has proven is since computers has been invented the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead @ORGANIZATION1 students reading long boring article on someone or something they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother syas when she was younger the computer gave her the ability to learn about far away places. My mother said that the internet would also let you learn about people customs rather than reading books because some books have not yet been upgraded and you would want to learn about their newest customs also. My mom thinks that using computer is a posotive effect on the world. @CAPS1 you are doing a fine job at writing at your job. My friends say computers are helpful, research has proven that computers have dropped the percentage at violence down, my also thinks that the computers is a posotive effect on us. I know you will agree with me when I say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people it gives people an easier time in life.

They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online. Computers are very important to people who work with them.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 being able to find the information of anything with only one hand. Computers benefit people because the can talk online with others. Also people have the advantage of learning about faraway places. Lastly you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily. Computers do benefit society. Furthermore, with computures people can talk online with others easily. All @ORGANIZATION1 students use the computer daily to video chat with friends or instant message parents! @ORGANIZATION2 discovered that computers keep families closer because they are able to see each other virtualy when someone is away. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 use their computers to talk with others online. One could see why computers are bad, but @CAPS5 they benefit a lot of people everyday. @CAPS1 walking into a room where people of all are learning about computers are helpful to @CAPS6 individual because the can learn about places. Computer says "Computers are information in a compact " @CAPS3 out of @CAPS4 people use the computer learn about far away places. The @LOCATION1 lives had found that using the computer to learn about far away places than using multiple , Some can use why books are to use, @CAPS5 omputers are. Lastly, computers are great because they teach @CAPS6 to have better, @PERCENT2 of people found their after using the computer for one haour. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, says "The computer can help to develope stronger reflexes." @CAPS6 could see why computer slow reflexes, but @CAPS5 they mae them better. Computers benefit society greatly. Computers help people talk online with others. Also people can learn about faraway places. Lastly the computer strengthens hand eye coordination

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No they @CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but it also have many negitive effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less than exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active. I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along. I'm sure olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there so I don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Wether you hiking a mountain of a lake, nature is all around you. I personaly love to hunt and fish. I take the time every sumer, @DATE1, fall,and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to with family or friends. If you the computer all day ther you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with you brother. If you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you just a person. You won't valueable thing that you have in life you r family and you @CAPS2 always be able to make time them. Finally, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they @CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers take time away from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. There are good things about computers, but the less time you spend on them, the better it is for everyone.

@ORGANIZATION1, In @DATE1, more and more of the newest technology is being brought out to the public. Computers, @CAPS1-bars, telephones, and more are getting the most hi-tech softwares and machinery to @CAPS8 some of the most meraculous things happen. There is a cell-phone that allows you to turn of you lights in your house from thousands of miles today. This technology can be the best thing that has ever happend to the world. Some might argue that though. But I am here to argue The @CAPS2-sayers. With the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world. Also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow @CAPS3. Also, questions that have been asked can now be answered. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 who I only talk to if I go to visit @CAPS3 which is very rare. Because of some of The programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to converse with @CAPS7 cousins. Some people say That The @ORGANIZATION2 can @CAPS8 kids like me want to miss out on some quality-time with @CAPS7 family. Well, @CAPS7 brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I am going to want to talk with him. With phone companies haunting their costumers with scary prices, @CAPS7 family is not going to want to sit on The phone with him for @NUM1 hours and have to cut into their savings. On @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i-chat which allows me to talk with @CAPS7 brother and see him as if he were home with me. @CAPS7 dad found out about @CAPS4 and he decided to try it out. As of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high-school Friends @CAPS13 get back in the game. Maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 of even @LOCATION4- @CAPS14 places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. Also @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, incudes tourtorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more @CAPS13 you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. Another good thing about the @ORGANIZATION2 is it offers mostly reliable information. Sorry didn't get to finish @NUM2 paragraph & conlusion.

Dear local newspaper, I've heard that you were taking a survey to see if people believe in computers or not. Well I'm someone who does because they can talk to there family and friends on sites like facebook, myspace, & aim. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to youtube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over @NUM1 people use computers and it is like @PERCENT1 adults anfd @PERCENT2 children use computers which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no compers, then how ill the type there work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, the you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game. There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer. When you first move somewhere oout of town, you can go to google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to. But there is so man things that you can do online and on computers. So thanks for letting me help you with your decision.

No @CAPS1 is not true just listen to the reasons why in a computer you can find people that you'r looking for. Also @CAPS1 can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities. If you keep on reading you are going to see all the tipical reasons why I think that people are not spending much time on computers than with their families. (@NUM1) @CAPS2 reason why I think that people are not spending much time on computerr is because, the computer can help you look for a family member that your looking for or a friend. My second reason why I think this is because naybe you never met that family member and you want to get to know them. My last reason why I think this is because @CAPS1's really a person that you really love and need in your personal like. These are the reasons why I think that they are not spending to much times on the computers.

Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well @MONTH1 need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer, look it up and importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computer hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful peices of equipment.

Computers effect a lot of people. I fully support the advances in technology. I support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. In addition, computers let you learn about countrys all over the word. Rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. Consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is an example of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball you should dribble and look ahead. Kinda like typing. As one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4 you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. Lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. In conclusion, computers should be advanced.

Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day to day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways including making learning easier, helps students do better in @CAPS4, nad serves as a great teaching tool. One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask hao a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, @CAPS1 sounds crazy, but its true! Let's say you're a middle @CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; @CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just google search what your topic in and @CAPS3! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, prettty cool right? Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you @CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @CAPS4? That's right, computers allow students to do better in @CAPS4. Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with things like absentees, weekends and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back @CAPS1's time for a chapter test with @PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you didn't do @CAPS2 on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do @CAPS2 on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @CAPS2 on the test. As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, @CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language? @CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you understand why computers are useful, now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community.
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benifits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study.

I think that computers have positive effects on peole. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. Finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. And @PERCENT1 of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. You can share you want with people you barely see. Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. If you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. These are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why I believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.

Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a humongous positive effect on people. I support advances in technology. It's @DATE1; we shouldn't be finsing information in books or writing everything by hand anymore. Life has gotten easier for everyone. Everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family. We are able to learn things quicker by using computers. Working citizens use computers to help them with important jobs! Everything is done on computers! Computers serve as a great source of communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account allows you to chat with people all over the world. It's much easier to talk to someone online for long periods of time because you won't have to pay for phane minutes! Even @CAPS4 chats are avaibale for computer users. Having a @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 allows you to do a video chat with someone. It makes you feel like thay are actually there in the room with you. If you have a close friend who moved across the country, then these ways to communicate would be very helpful to you! You cant have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we need computers! Computers have made our generation very intelligent. We can easily look up facts about anything on the computer. Now, if there's something we're curious about, we can just look it up on google. In the past, we wouldn't feel like looking in a book so we waid forget about it. Kids could get help with homework online if they are too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we could even take online college courses! Being able to go to college at home can really come in handy in some people. Computers help us with our education. Adults who go to work everyday really need to use computers! people working in the medicine field, use computers to keep track of all their patients. Now @CAPS6 use computers to organize lesson plans and print out reminders for their students. Scientists use computers to do research on things for their ecperiments. Engineers use programs on the computers to help design what they are going to build. Computers wvwn allow you ti advertise your small business or company to the whole entire world. Computers have a really positive effect on jobs in our society, which is a good thing for our economy! Computers benifit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can improve our hand eye cordination. We can learn about many things from computers! They really make us more intelligent! Computers give us a way to communicate with long distance friends and family. Websites like @CAPS7-@CAPS8 even give adulsts a chance to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are infinite, but we need to learn not to take them for granted.

Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communucation, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it couldn't agree more. Computers maybe useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolesents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and its because young people are glued to their computer screens. The averange child need @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little none. I say the computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework. Also, @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, @CAPS6 turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend @CAPS6 of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk as many comers, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. Its better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, its very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside have @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversation with a friend and internet with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing any at the keyboard.

Dear Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing, people use computers for buissness. Computers allow you to interact with people far away. They also allow you to do research. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for buissness. Some people work at home on computers. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other buissnesses you interact with. Computers are good. Some people use computers for buissness. You can also interact with people far away. You can even do research on a computer that is why computers are good.

Dear Local Newspaper, I have been asked to write a letter stating @CAPS5 opinion on the effects, computers have on people. Some experts have been worried people are not spending enough time outside, but most people are not spending enough time outside, but most people support advances in technology. During this time, computers are becoming more and more popular. They are very helpful in many ways. They allow you to learn new things, are very helpful for school and work, and they can keep family an friends connected. Computers have a positive and helpful effect on people. To begin, computers help you learn new things. If ever there is a question no one knows the answer to "@CAPS1 it!" @CAPS1 along with many other search engines are an easy way to find what you are looking for. For example, one day a few of @CAPS5 family friends come over we were eating dinner. the discution lead to the question of "who is the @CAPS6 that plaies @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4?" @CAPS5 little sister typed "@CAPS6 of @CAPS3 in the movie the @CAPS4" and @CAPS9! There it is @PERSON1. Just like that, computers help to get questions answered fast. Computers also help you learn new things like typing skills. just learning how to work them is a new skill. A recent poll shows that @PERCENT2 of people in nursing homes who learn how to use the computer have much better brain function. Although, there are much stronger reasons as to why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers help people with work and school. Computers help you send e-mails for work, make slide shows for presentations, and keep calendars so you can be organised and on time. @PERCENT1 of people use computers in some way to benifit in work.
<START>

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I believe that computers benefit society. Computers are a wonderful household object to have that make life easier in many ways. Computers allow the everyday family to see new places, through photos online, and people, through the internet. Computers also provide a social networking throught a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something, because there is always something on the internet that will help you. There's a famous quote that goes, "the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement." In my opinion, the computers could make that room a little smaller. While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors, and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a wide ocean of pictures, wordes, and sounds. The computer is the item that organizes it, for your entertainment. There is a picture of just about anything imaginaeable on the internet; from the palm shaped islands of @LOCATION1, to the frozen @CAPS1 tundra in the @LOCATION3. You are able to see penguins in the southern ice cap and the ricefields of @LOCATION2 a bird's eye view all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not just to see places but to see people from how for the distance is! Today, people are sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their memories with each other, all thanks for the computer. I hope what I have just explained now helps me make my. Computers are only here to make our lives. Imagine talking to your friends, not having an with his ever leaving your room. This would or even an impossibility fifty or seventy @DATE1, but this is People's social relationship have greatly progressed the half and it only goes has allowed people to their up on the their up on the their with their family and friends. I'll always a positive thing, using this right way. Having your house to tell, individually, your friend about your time to disney world is such a hastle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like facebook, or twitter, memories will be stored through, litterally, the clicks of aborton. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planing a vacation is a trough job to do, but what if that job could all take place in our sport? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in @DATE1 minuets for less using the computer. This allows people more time to go have fun with their lives and not have to worry about plannings. Computers allow people to compress hours of work into a matter of minutes. Experts say that computers are taking away people's lives" I would disagree, because; people are new places or people, social networking is more advanced, and time that could have been spent planning is now living.

Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, @CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. "I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money." I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say "bye" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society.

Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 "isn't that great"!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1't you love to go in your computer? @CAPS1't you get a lot done on them? Well I think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get there jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper keep reading and I will change your mind about computers effects on people. Do you have family or friends who @CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in @CAPS2 I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, teacher, she has using the computer to email parents if the student need help or up. So as you can see computers have good effect on our society. These are my reasons : you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do research on projects, and helps people do research on projects, and helps people get there jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers good effect!

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too.

Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 oppinion I think that those who makes compiuters should make up an times added to the compiuters. There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!

I think that computers help people in there everyday lives. They just make things so much easier. Computers help us to find information @CAPS2 we needed. Book hotels and airliners, they even allow us to interact with our friends. Yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising, but we can find out away to do both. Everyday I would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball. People just need to find a way to it out. Computers are good for if you need to find information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire. For example if you are in @CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information. People all over the world do that just about everyday. It is also a great place if you need information if you are doing a project in school and you need more info on your subject @CAPS2 I say it make things a lot easier there is no better example a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. Both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then. If we didn't have computers you would need to go to the hotel and get a room, and if there were no room you out of luck. On a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to @CAPS3 tickets would have the exact same thing. Computer say @CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much. So @CAPS2 you go to the airport you are not surprised. Another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family @CAPS2 you can't see them. There so many different ways you can do it to. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, myspace. All the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends. Even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then. I even do that with my brother, he is in college and I dont see him that much so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Thing like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, ect. All help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives.

Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.

Dear town of southing ton, Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also I know this from expieriance becouse I am a teanager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's @PERSON1 that of homeworld. Please take my advise and your happy caring family will always stay togeather and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing videos games.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public is writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about on the subject of if people spend to much time on the computer. My first idea is sometimes people do spend to much time on the computer than usual. Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght & start to lose control over the eating habits. My second idea is computers do alot of things for us. But there are still alot of things a computer cant teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always find something to do outside but whats sometimes different with a computer. My last & final idea is people become to attached to their computers & lose sight of what really matter, such as exercising & fitnesss. Then people are angry when their computer chrashes & forget how to do things because their always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.

Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on todays society. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. So dont let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog. Youve heard the facts now make the right decision.

Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, "grades are the most imfortant thing." I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,

Knoleg is one of the greatest quests for mankind, always trying to figure out how and why things happen. @CAPS1 to this natural ciricusity we have made amazing leaps in Technology @NUM1 years ago what seemed to be imposible is now possible. And one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benafate to society becaus, you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, allow you to talk to people around the world and @CAPS5 give you better hand eye cordenation. The first reson I think that computers are great modern society, is that we can learn instantly about foren countrys. @NUM1 years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet we can learn around the world what is happening ware you want to know. "@CAPS1 to our modern techolagy people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever befor." stated @PERSON3, a @CAPS2 expert from @ORGANIZATION2 university of @CAPS2. "@CAPS4 computers and the ability to colect information @CAPS7 quily compared to @NUM1 years ago." @CAPS5 @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't have known anything about the recent earth quake in @CAPS6. @CAPS5 with computers we can now talk istantly with people over the internet. A century ago talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible. But @CAPS1 to technology that of thing is an avarage part of our lives." @CAPS7 many of our advancements and dicisions are made while we talk online, even some of the worlds gratests leaders make the hard decisions becaus of this advansments," stated @PERSON1, a reporter for the new @CAPS8 times. "@CAPS9 this technology many of the decisions made in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS10 wouldn't be made and many solders would have died as a result." @CAPS11 final reson that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is throug video games and simulations. In video games people make it @CAPS7 you to react at a movements notes in order to compleat your objective. In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through this situations, many sledres have learn how to servive in combat and save many of their fellow comredes. "The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectevness by over @PERCENT1" stated general @PERSON2 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS12. "@CAPS9 theise simulations many more american lives weold have ben lost in recent wars." @CAPS14 now that you have heard all of @CAPS11 resons of why I support computers. I hope you are much more informed about this topic @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't be able to learn about foren lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand eye cooordination. I hope everyone else will see @CAPS11 resons for supporting computers.

Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you all @MONTH1 know many people in our town have been quarreling about computers. Some people are pro computer useage and others not so much. In my opinoin computers are a great @CAPS2 technology. One way computers benefits our society is ability to access ample information, pictures, and news. Also you can chat with @CAPS2 or old friends. Another good thing about computers is you can also have fun on the web, watch movies, even go shopping. Have you ever done a report on on a far away country? Maybe you've never heard of @LOCATION2 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. So wat do you do? Serch the web! Instead of taking a walk to the libriary just serch one of the many serch engines such @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS5! @PERCENT1 of people nowadays have at least one maybe two computers in their household. @PERCENT2 of people can access the web on their cell phone! Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessable on the web. You could @CAPS12 just about anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wandered about current events in our country or others? On certain cites you can live newsfeeds or an article about something @CAPS2 such @CAPS1 the earthquake in @LOCATION4 that recently happended. The internet is benefitting our society today. Aim is just one of many private chat rooms that is avalible to people. On these open chat rooms you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away. "I was on @CAPS6 looking for my friend @CAPS7 and I found her page before this year we didn'@CAPS8 talk @CAPS1 much but now we can talk through face book we hangout and talk all the time!" comments @LOCATION3 avid @CAPS6 user. Dating cites are now avalible, too. There you can meet @CAPS2 people a develope a relationship with them. Entertainment is everywhere on the internet. You can play a variety of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite @CAPS8.V show, streame live movies, watch viddeos on @CAPS9, and much more! Many people think there are only pointless games on the comuter but there are educational fun games @CAPS1 well such @CAPS1 @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and @CAPS12 to learn. Did you know that more than @PERCENT3 of shopping for clothes car parts and other things are bought an auction such @CAPS1 ebay and amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I was going to see or movie but we weren'@CAPS8 sure wat was playing or what times they started at. So we simply looked on the cinema's website. So now you now where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers are a great reference point, can allow you to chat with

@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers"
<START>

In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free. So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use cpu. Also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to thier family . So if you don't have a cpu you get one and will do other fun stuff you like.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers were invented they have grown so much, which make a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more. More and More people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who suffort advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer; not exercising, there are many dangers, and less interacting with family and friends. First @ORGANIZATION1 all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, @CAPS3 spoke to a local @CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out, @CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night." This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past. I try to cut back on my computer times, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have @ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently the new biggest site is facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with webcam. There could be a time when a teen "meets" someone on-line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing youngs they can in danger. @CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins it so much better and fun. I do e-mail my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when @CAPS3 have get togethers. Now a day it's not like that for a lot @ORGANIZATION1 people. Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also, negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot @ORGANIZATION1 time have dangerous risks, and take away interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my terms."

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!

Do computers really benifit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in tecknology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on thier families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. "The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on," says @PERSON2. "They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier." This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers alot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes comunication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. "@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are." says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new "friend" they've made. So remember, even though computers are

Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dillemant @CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, @CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, "Computers save people everyday". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, @CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, @CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were @CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way.

@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occations. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important becuase people can learn about history and important figures in life. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is usefull because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religious and also their cultures and heritage. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world.
<START>

To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a "@CAPS1 @CAPS2" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives.

Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who? Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination. The help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. So now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers. Again I thank you for reading this letter.

Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible.
<START>

I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipies. Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like weather, ideas you have, you can even plan exercise days. What if something important happens? The person does not have his or hers phone. What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand eye cordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field. Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are. In conclusion, I believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do. Like talk to friends, look up info and teach skills.

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer while I think that is great other don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced. As for school @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brouchures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dementional. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet saftey and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about cocrent civilizations. Or modern day without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has vertual simulations so you can experence what it was like in other coultures, in other time pericals. Computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. Even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge I do. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool.

Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers.

Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's.

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I was sitting at home when I have realized this has to come to an end! The computer bissness has taken my mother and my stepfather away from me, I mean when they are on facebook they are in a whole nother galaxcey. The family spends no time together what so ever. Also, they argue, dont sleep and again, we don't spend anytime together! Not spending time with family isn't a good thing. Social activity is good for everyone. Even if the time spending is not with family, socializum is a very important rollplay in use. On the other hand arguing isn't. Arguing just decreases the social time spent. Arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer. Now if were arguing about the computer then we have a huge problem. The arguing will never end! Not sleeping is my biggest concern though, when they are up all nite on that stupid thing, oh gosh don't get me started. I believe they don't have good days during the day when in school. Actually I know they don't because they are day. Computers cause my parents to use up family time, fight, and not sleep, they spend more time on the personal computer than I'm a! @CITY1 @PERSON1, I think we have a problem. A very big one!
<START>

I believe that people spend too much time on the computers. If people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. They don’t get enough exercise.most teens aren't getting home work done because of this @CAPS1 people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light. Sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise. You mostly just move your hands and fingers. If people dont exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week. Lastly, your teenager probably do their homework. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes. which means they will most likely stay back. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this most people will lose eye sight. if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. I believe that computers help as much more than hurt. There are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people, but @CAPS2 more instances where they have helped @CAPS2 people. There are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers. Likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the @CAPS3. Also, people could learn about amazing places. Thus computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes. In my experience as a computer engineer. I have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment. The victem could see exactaly what he is doing and so could his and doctors. Like wise to the physical treatment, computers an relief. Thus the patient gets stronger physically and mentaly. Thus, computers help a humans life be enchacing their reflexes. Likewise to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would help people that are distance apart could connect. One of the ways people very far away connect is with soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing helped better than talking. The easiest way of this was talking over. It gave me a gigantic. Thus computers are vital to as humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 year-old boy visits a website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest. He then tells his science class, who the spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, finding new speceses. All this would happen because he was on a computers. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth, Computers are vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans.

Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type "@CAPS2 of @PERSON1" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, "I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home." @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers.

Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far away friends or unknown frieds. If they are far its a nice way to send photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If thats not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your computer chair all day can improve your posture. Your back can get straigher from all time you are sitting. Your mind can be foucused and in one pot fucusing on thing is good for you such as the computer screen. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way.
<START>

Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. We need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites! People are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! Your no enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 love oceans with pink sand. Who would want to miss this? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house. Just think you won't be able to see the stupendous, the seasons changing, withought going outdoors. "I want my @CAPS6, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old." @CAPS5 of her daughter. Well, @MONTH1 I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! Yes, comuters, are very brilliant, and have lots to do, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world. The greatest impart is the computer! high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. Now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy excersise, and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowy add on to your and gain issues as you the internet? I remember @DATE1, I grabred my nike hightops, and my pink ipod I started jogging at a slow while listening to my favorite song. Naturally by I felt amazing when my was complete going each day is as healthy as eating a bannana, @NUM1 apples, and cheese eery morning their healthy! "@CAPS7 since technology has been a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grand parents in over @NUM1 years! This needs to step!" @CAPS8 @PERSON1 to the press. Yes, comuters have "online-talking" devices such as @CAPS9, but if you are never going to spend quality time with family, this is a bad habbit. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I, were too busy on the computer, we missed a birthday party the family we are addicted to this device, and need to spend time with our loved ones. @PERCENT3 of all therapy computers have @CAPS2 into depresion and have been with their plains, due to the high amount of to do on this device and less time bonding with members of your Who would rather play on a old, gray, computer when you can have fun talking about you day and the game life with your family? @CAPS10's now a never! What will you choose? Do you agree that computers take over lives? If you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big and many people are missing out on the advantage technology is taking over peoples excersing habbits, and many families are less bonding @CAPS10's up to you keep the population of @LOCATION1 in good hands!

Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell "what" instead the @PERCENT1 would spell "@CAPS2". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @PERCENT1 of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more intrested in learning. Also, using a computer ables you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to florida, and now we webchat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost . Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor @CAPS2 even stated, "every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer." In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later.

Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say "that would never happen to me" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer.

Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1 have been. Computers were mode to simply difficult situations, such as typing, finding, , and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many @CAPS3 citizens have been using the computer for that are neccessary which result in a loss of to living a healthy, social, life. these are exercisem and spending line with fellow people indicating family and friends. as a result, please read on so that you, the @CAPS4 our can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your. One much life is exercise, and due to the of modern computers, exercise is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the dese children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the foor heart- children begin to their computers from the second will home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep, eat, computer. This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power/ muscle to depend themselves from. Another reason whay computers are thinking such a @LOCATION1's youth, is because of less than medicine usage of. Everyday I chose to walk from school, for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you I @CAPS5, spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non-stop, @CAPS6, playing video games, and all sorts of computer-released activities. every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, to on the computer, and began my , as I @LOCATION2. This resulted loosing the time I had with my mosue. Furthermore, if I needed is contact @MONTH1 friends, I just @CAPS7 them, rather than speaking in person,. Over line both my family and friends and grow of this electronic device, called the computer luckily, @ORGANIZATION1 nothing like that now however, I hope that you see the side to the computer, and how loosing your family and friends possibly. In conclusion, @ORGANIZATION1 guarantee that with all the information about how are out. Hopefully you will the paper of @CAPS1 of our newspaper and demand a column about computer loose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for letter, and I will an article relative to this subject.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, aren’t as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didn’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn’t know. So, let’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn’t do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.

I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?
<START>

Dear local newspaper, I disagree because it would give kids, children to do negative thing like being rude, not listening, being loud, not doing homework just because your on the computers. Please listen to why I disagree here are some reason why. I know when i am on the computer my mom every @NUM1 mins what you own because there nasty things on that computers that kids, children be looking at you never now they could learn how to kill someone just being on the computer. I know when I go on that computer I am rude and disrespectful because when I am on you can tell me nothing because I was into the computer my attention move to the computer. Thats why they should have @CAPS1 computers because it takes the attention. I don't listen while I am on the computer my mom tell's me to get on " I will say "@CAPS1" I am doing some thing she will tell me to get off i @CAPS1 leave me alone because I am on the computer and because I am focus on the computer. And I have the computer loud so @CAPS1 one could get my attention so I have the computer allways loud because my main focus was the computer than I'll do whatever later. O and I don't even remember what be happend when I get on the computer. Not doing your school. I know I be telling my mom let me use the computer so I could do my school work and I be getting on different things instead f doing my homework my mom be like t through you were doing you homework and say "I did finish my homework when I know I did not finish my homework but I only say it because my focus was on the ocmputer. These are reason why the society should take back the computer. I hope you undertand the reasons I give you because the society should really stop giving out the computers in the first place. If you have a daughter or a son and know they have said some of thease things now you know you children have been and always lied to you. Know I could olny the computer for @NUM2 min each day. So yes take them away.

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. "@ORGANIZATION3" allows people to have what can be called a "visual phone conversation." A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, "@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile." @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick "hello" can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. "@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler," says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, "and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud." Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, "@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well." @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society."

Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable "@CAPS1," toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 "help," one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, "@CAPS2," @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing "homework," there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem "fun," but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I don’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, In my opinon I think computers do have a positive affect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the launage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive affect on people.

According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer.

Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like "google" and "yahoo". They also use the internet for communication like "facebook" and "aim". Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family "e-mail" is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is "facebook". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is "aim". This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with "video-chatting". My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without "aim". Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up info, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about

I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says "computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. "@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.

Many People in Society think computers are bad, I think computers are exellent. Computers allow you to comunicate with your friends, family and relatives. With a computer you can do home work extra fast, no having to go to the library to look stuff up. Computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros. Muny experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to stranger on website like facebook and myspace. If parent place him son the websites and also make it so only freinds can you profile you will be alot safer. Comunications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk from it online than not I know he is correct because I have relatile in the @LOCATION1 that I love talking to but they are @NUM1 miles away so communication is or I to get, then I got a facebook and it is like they are next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are molestores/ thugs go, after, people who don't protect their profile so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the libra! This is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go. With a computer you can just go into your office and do re search, That saves money or gas. If you have a prodject of you can just send it straight to they teacher. In many today experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 a conducting experiment that are rigged. Violence they say is cursed by the games but they use test subjects like an the bad people you dont want to meet. I Have found video games to be a great let out for stress biut up during the day. Muny of my friends have also found this. Video games make you think that is also reason they are good. In conclusion computers are exelent. They make it so ther is the ability to communicate with friends alow you to take out anger. What is not to love? Get a computer now!!

Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too.

Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers. The reason for this is that one, people don't get enough exercise. Two, new websites have been made and people want to see how @CAPS1 works. Three, more and more teenage kids have the new technology. Their on @CAPS1 all the time, and don't realize their not spending any time with their family. Now that you know that lets move on to my first reason. First of all, people are spending a lot of time on the computer they don't have time to go outside and exercise, More people probably figure they don't need to go outside. Really they do, @CAPS1's important that they get their body moving and blood flowing through their body. Another thing is that we don't always need to get the answers off the computer. @CAPS1's east to find friend and play a game with them. Find something to do other than play games on the computer. Now that you know let's move on the second reason. Second of all, the computer network came up with new ideas for the computer. They now have facebook. More and more people use facebook now. This right here shows us they won't get out and play, this also means most kids won't do their homework. Another thing is that either parents set a time on the computer or they take @CAPS1 a way. Their is just so much amount of time you can be on the computer for and not get bored. Now that you know that lets move on to the last reason. Third of all, I would like to say people are spending more time on the computer than with their own family. The reason I say this is because @CAPS1 is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer @NUM1. We need to know also what's going on in our daily life. Another thing is that our family is way better than some game on the computer go outside with you family and play a game of wiffle ball. Now that you know that lets moves on to the conclusion. In conclusion, You have read an essay talking about how people spend more time on the computer rather than go outside to exersice, new website to keep them on longer, and not spending enough time with their family and friends. @CAPS1 is important to have a time limite on the computer and get up and moving. Don't be a lazy couch potato and sit on the computer all day get out and spend time with you family and friends, I hope you agree with me.

Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, im sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dont talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and

Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of money donated to @ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. "They have made a great deal of positive impact." he states. "@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots." @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states "@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly." @CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!

Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are out! The effects of over-use on a computer can severely change a persons life! People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercisizing enjoying nature, and interaction with their family member and friends. I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass inter of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead so home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming into work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation, childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get heard playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The rates of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer has invented. But a mere ten years later, the changed so now their are squirrels! This is because now that they less people feeling less squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, went live in the to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, we being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held to have three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the mere time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three freinds @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and

I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer. An article said, too much computer using. I though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He past his hour playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tries out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does grate in school too. Others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer everytime he comes from school. He don't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. Other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are an major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Agains computer would be the right thing to do.

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.

Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 ets. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes & to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called "my brother @CAPS5 is dead" and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.

Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, "@CAPS2-bullying." @CAPS2-bullying can be derined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as "Give me your lunch money", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why ananymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-wiegh the positives.

Dear Newspaper, Computers are not a benfit for us because we spent to much time on them not every one has a computer and they cost of a computer. Every one dosen't know how to use it. If we timed many hours we spend on the computer people would be amazed at what they sound. People spend looking up random things when they could be outside rideing biks or going sur awalk. And you cant do that with a computer. Not everyone hase a computer because that cost so much @MONEY1 a bacik computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 and more and thats @MONEY1 sur ther computer. Then you have to pay sur the internet witch can so sur @NUM2 a month. And you have to pay for surton aps like (windos, microsoft ect.) The bill on a computer up outer a while and people dont relize that when they are payings for the internet they arnt getting allot what the cable com sars they on giving you. Not every are knows how to use a computer lik older adults dont know how to really know use the full ptonole of a computer. Because they never learnd how to use computer. In this is the computer arnt a hose help for our society.Coose of the time and the cost and the knolage on computers.

Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. 
<START>

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in"nike sb skate lair demo" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount.
<START>

Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definetly agree that computers have a benificial effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and they give people the chance to recconnect or new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutley benifical. Studies done by @PERSON1, doctor at @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. I know personally that it has help us. Since @CAPS2 been on the computer more I have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers to learn about the far away places. Kevin, scientist that @PERCENT2 of our knowing about space come from computers! For example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? By these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. Clearly this is a great source to use! The time has come to decide the choice of using computers would deffinetly be a wise one. Without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. Most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer.
<START>

Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want to learn good hand-eye coordination? @CAPS1 you want to have the ability to learn about far away places? And @CAPS1 you want to talk online with other people? If you said @CAPS3 to all of these questions then using a computer is the way to go! While using a computer you can @CAPS1 many things. You can look up a good healty recipe for your family or find a good relaxing place to @CAPS1 your daliy yoga. Although some people say that using a computer cuts down your time for exercising and enjoying nature, but it really doesn't. A recent poll was talking at the planet fitness in newington @CAPS2 and it showed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising people discovered planet fitness by the internet. @PERSON1 nature of the department of health and wellness said "@PERCENT2 of my customers take online corses of exercising at home so that they don't have to be in public." @CAPS3 i know it seems lazy to not go to a gym but, some people are terrified about what others think at them, so its I mean who doesn't want to exerise in the warning conforts of your own home and not have to go to a sweaty old gym? All right-minded people would stay at home and exersie from thier computer and not have to go to a sweaty and smelly gym. So its never. @CAPS1 you go to a sweaty old gym, or @CAPS1 you stay at your beautiful clean have with the inernet? Image, as soon as you get up in the well rested, instead of going to a yuchy gym you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing walk out in the comfort of your own home. Certently you care about your nose and want to be able to smell a nice warn apple one. But if you dont thats fine too. So don't go to a gym, stay at home and enjoy your day with your internet!!! I say stay at name and love your internet!!!

Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.
<START>

I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether @CAPS3's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers peplace old and haved ways @ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead @ORGANIZATION1 writing a letter to someone, mailinbg @CAPS3 to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive @CAPS3, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough @PERSON1, president @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1, says, "Computers are an important part fo technology. People use them everyday." @CAPS1 them everyday doesn't mean just for fun. @CAPS3 also helps with work. Three out @ORGANIZATION1 four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fst. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 hand-writing that four-page essay on @PERSON2 @CAPS1 textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case @ORGANIZATION1 missed classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days @ORGANIZATION1 school, says, "@CAPS2 I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me @CAPS2 the homework assignment. I missed @CAPS3 was that easy." @CAPS4's not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions @ORGANIZATION1 kids & adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allows them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates @CAPS3 when their camera or video camera breaks, and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 people who store @CAPS2 their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do @CAPS3. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online. do homework & projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life. We just woudn't be the world we are without them.

Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!

Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the "real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also. Most people who are and again. These of into an life because you do enjoying at all. For example, people die of. This letter will effect others so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I dont agree.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 are big aguments about if computers are good or bad. I think that computers benifit our society. Why, because it makes socializeing easir, You can gain lots of education and also help with buisnesses. Wow, I cant believe how easy it it to ather people with computers. Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with freinds. It help peoples socialize by letting messages on paper that to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an oportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education. Computers have done lots of things but not as much stuff as the did for buisnessed. The computer itself was a busness and people model lots of money. It helped buisnessed organize @CAPS1 work and money also its given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also it gave buisnesses, quicker, more eficiant way to put up for people to by @CAPS1. Computers have played a vital role in creating our economy. Computers have made socialize long easer. The ability us to get more education. Also it helps with our buisnesses This is why I think that computers have benifited our society.

Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll report myself again I'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. I'm talking about the people that don't work in computers.

I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening.
<START>

What compters stop you from doing is your homework in school. But when you do something on the computer your not soposes to do, you get stuck on a website you can't get off your screen. So what I'm trying to say is to don't stay on the computer than just @NUM1 min.
<START>

Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today.

Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time.

Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion is yes people are on the computer to much. I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry. And your spend all your time on the computer. Bye for now.

Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @CAPS5 you didn’t ha a @CAPS3? I know I couldn’t. Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can tlk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for comoputer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says "@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places." @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book. In conclusion the @CAPS3 has benifits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just end all-around benifits.

To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you don't want to surromb to the computers. put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Experts agree, that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. @PERSON1, an obesity expert, says, "I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of @CAPS1." @CAPS1 can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. Theyre too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew @PERSON2, a park ranger, says. "In the past few years. we have had less visitors than ever before." @CAPS2 people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national, there is obviously something wrong. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say @PERCENT1 of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says. "I have seen as definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around". She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers @MONTH1 not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. @CAPS2 we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn of the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers.
<START>

Dear local newspaper, People spend to much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer. There fore I do not agree with people who say computers benifit the society. @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. A lot of peoples skin is jiggily and fat because of computers. @CAPS5 you @MONTH1 ask? People sit in front of there computers all day when they could spend that time exercising, my dad got extremly over weight when we got a new computer. All he did was sit and play games like @CAPS1 wars or @CAPS2. I couldn't beleive @CAPS5 fat he got so my mom told him and now instead of playing on the computer he goes to the gym. You wouldn't beleive @CAPS5 much weight he lost. Also did you know that america is one of the fatist countrys because people don't exercize and just play on ther laptops and computers. So it would help america alot to stop playing softwear and start exersizing. So many people miss out on the butiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover so much to be explored. So yes you could find the gisers in yellow stone online but it's nothing like seeing in real life. If there were computers back in the early @DATE1's people would never had the earge to find new land, you don't hear of many great explorers now do you? I bet if every one took a break from computer new spicies would be found or maybe even a cure for canser. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the buitful part of nature. "@CAPS3 come down and talk to your grand parents." "@CAPS4 mom I'm playing on the computer!" @CAPS5 many times has this happend to you? Has your son or daughter been on the computer with great @PERSON1 has been over? They @MONTH1 have wanted to play the computer then but they don't know if thats could have been there last day with him or her. Computer will be here forever or almost forever, peoples time is limited. There fore hanging out with a relitive is much more imortant than playing on the computer. I know a kid named @PERSON2 who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. @PERSON2 said @CAPS4. His friend was so disiponded and angry. I would be too. Whould you like to have a friend pick computer over you? I'd hope not. There fore computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion qualiy time with people, nature, and exercize is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree the computers do not always help society.

Dear newspapper I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don’t believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don’t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed. The town of @LOCATION1 police @CAPS1 says that over @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook. The police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I dont think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I dont think computers benifit us. I hope you too heed to my advice.

In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in "language of @CAPS2", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, "locate area", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?

The computer is a good way to contact family and friend. People send messages all over the world or just to fon. People like playing video games or be on websites that they like. People all over the world by laptops to travel to one place to another. Everybody don't be on computer because they think its not go to have but some people do like to have one to be sending messages to hang out with one another or be talking about how was your day. Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on ebay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1. Every seens the new computers came out people been buying a lot the company been making a lot @MONEY1 money from making the touch screen computers. Every new year the company make new computers so they can get thousands or @MONEY1. Company all over world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and @CAPS2 them. New styles they make more money they make. Some people make their own companies to get money like the other companys get theirs, but some @MONEY1 the money you make some goes to the government. The money the give to the government is to take care @MONEY1 the homeless people. Computers are used from leaning or for fun. People share computers with other people they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take turne using it. Some people don't like taking turn with one another. Everybody share or have they own and they use it or not they can't force their server to it if somebody wants to net on it. Some people lie and say they were geting on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a tag to play with computers cost a lot to repair and get it fixed all the people spill water on them a the computer mess up and the people be mad and maybe he/she just got a new computer. When computer first came out people bought them to see what they will be like. Many people liked them and it got all over the world and people were talking about them and the company made more and more until it got in stores all over the world. The computer got famase and the company made newer styles for everyone else. People bought a lot @MONEY1 computers everytime they come out with a new style. Many people had @NUM1, or @NUM2 at home as they @CAPS2 them. Companys made other company mad because the other companys were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers. And company how make them is making a lot @MONEY1 money. Company stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the @CAPS1 one ever. When they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one. Some company joined to make one together.

Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, " Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me, i can't live without a computer." @CAPS2 my many local in the town of @LOCATION1. For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said "The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties.

Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Wether it be for a research project, talking to friends, and even answers for homework. Everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight. Moving your fingers doesnt count as exercise and it wastes energy. Many people I know would die if they didn't have a computer because friends are on or made because they need if for homework. These type of people need to be taught how to get things done withou technology because are day it might fail. Some students rely on there technology to work orthey will fail. These children need to be taught that there is other ways to do things. Like hanging out with friends, reading a book, and even doing their homework. Since students rely on their computers so much then always on them. Every day people I know go home and jump on @CAPS2 for the rest of the day. They never can do anything like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not do any type of athletic sport. Obessity is a huge problem in the @LOCATION1 are the numbers keep increasing drasticlly. Everyone thinks that it is beging caused by bad eating habbits, thats only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big problem. Children around the @LOCATION1 are stuck on their computers all day checking message, and seting up pictures. While these children are on the comptuer they dont even think they just chow down on "@CAPS3". This comptuer usage problem is beging to become at bigdeal with the obessity and hold much people rely on it for basically everything. So we need to be the first people to stop this befor it forms bad. This could be a huge problem in the future. So lets start to cut our usage time down now.
<START>

Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.

@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over. First off, computers are an easy way to have a universe of information at your fingertips. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 say that when assigned or paper or project the first source they use is from the internet. The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it." said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internets multiple online encyclopidias, amagazines, newssites or other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarden computer class where we'd reserch dinnosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certian procederes and ways to orginnaize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also with parents losing jobs in this ecconomic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I though we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have accually never been closer. And its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too. They connect for buissness through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing reserch faster to connecting with old friends, computers ar helping everyone."

Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative perks. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you then forget to excersize. Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends. Because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them. I am not saying to stop using computers. Because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer. It's not good for you! Secondly, you need excersize. Stastics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster would know because as @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more @CAPS1 are all well-known facts. That have been proven. Since, you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving. Meaning you stop excersizing. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benfit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye-site will pay. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that But, it also hurts your heath. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tunal syndrome. Which is very painful. Computers are so much fun and make life easier. But, they have disadvantages. Reason one you loose interaction with people. Reason two you stop excersizing. Reason three your health is at risk. If you limit time, everythig will be alright!
<START>

@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1 and I am writing to you because, I want to inform you about the benefits of having computers. I think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world. Having a computer also helps people in need and also inform people about far away places in the the world. I beleive if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't really know that much about our world. Computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1. Some people do not think that computers have an effect onour society but I for one think computers have a very positive effect on people. people also think that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I believe that it actually helps people to exercise because you can go gives different exercising techniques. In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on society.

Computers are good to use because it tells you everything. Like if you need a number to a restaurant you can just get it off the computer and sometimes when you wanna go on a vacation and if you wanna know how much it cost you go onto the computer. And computers are good because if you wanna travel to different places you can go onto the computer and look for a map and print it out. But sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids.

Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt using a computer helps us learn. The computer helps us learn about other places in the world. @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at beautiful places in the world. Computers also can teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that "taking spanish online helped im a lot on her class. Computers now offer online study groups that can help us get into a college. Many people would agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. Its a fact that you instead other people on computers. You meet new people when you are in the computer. Most people live meeting other people online. You also learn social on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social on the computer. People also can learn to have a personality because they in use. @PERSON2 says that "because I got on the computer I didn't have the personality but I feel like a whole person. As you interact with people on the computers. Did you know that a computer teacher in life say if you need to use a computer in your will one already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you type. Using a computer helped hand eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too os that can help you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for go out and go your computer today!

Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say "Time to get off... go get some fresh air." the kid always goes "one minute" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that "one minute" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1.

I think computers are good, because some people dont have phones so @CAPS1 a good way to conect with people you know, also meet new people. Second some people are going to collage when there done with high school so you could just look on the computers and find one you like and pricess, also find ways there. Third reason is ahopping if a holiday is coming up you could check online and find stuff for cheap and nice to you. You could also order it to your house online if you dont got alot of time to go shopping. @CAPS1 some reasons why I think online is good you could chat, find places and pricess, collages and also shop online @CAPS1 why online is good.

Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending to much time in the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person. Its to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers.

Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, "@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is "@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22," a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have.

Imagine your life without the benifits @ORGANIZATION2 the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develope @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 is very important to our sociotey. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 students use a computer to acces the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer @CAPS1 lets us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that "a near @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know." @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result @ORGANIZATION2 the informational acces the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a servey that was done by the @ORGANIZATION1, found that @PERCENT4 @ORGANIZATION2 students found more information, that was relavent, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developed. With @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs @ORGANIZATION2 students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting. With a phone you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 have this device to use. It @CAPS1 is preinstalled into many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, giving us portable acces to talk. CEO at @ORGANIZATION3 said that "@CAPS6 the laptops have come with c built in web cam, one out @ORGANIZATION2 every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for buisness." The computer can help with our communications for @CAPS3 or buisness needs. The computer is a good way to start and develope with @CAPS3 skills. More than @PERCENT6 @ORGANIZATION2 children use a computer to start with the begenings @ORGANIZATION2 their @CAPS3 skills. Computer allow many people to become @CAPS3 with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benafit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs and to our @CAPS3 needs, the computer positivley effets us in these two very important ways.

Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even @CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. There adveances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun!

The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of "@CAPS2", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows "good" websites to be viewed, and "bad" on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered "detrimental" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of @ORGANIZATION1.

Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for spicific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more spicific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that myspace and facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notife other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the bereathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a capenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are avalable to use or thats sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for gps so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as pog, cheatcodes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if somthing happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do.

Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.

Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will alway get fit faster if they excersise instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unpluged, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excersise which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monontenious videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more gradutes who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers.

Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers in there house hold but they disagrees with a computer can help you. There are some advantages in useing computers such as being able to search information able learn hand-eye coordination, becomeing organized, but it also has it's disadvangtages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going out side and playing with friends and exersizeing and staying fit. I agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only let a child stay in contact with their family that live faraway but it can also help them get a progect done more eveficantly and quickly. It @MONTH1 seem that where are doing one thing but when in fact we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading muisc and playing games at the same. Now with all that I have told you @DATE1 I hope that we share the same point of veiws on computers like how they are good to have and their positive in part.
<START>

Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are "taking over people", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad.

I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, "@CAPS3 @CAPS4." @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers.
<START>

Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!

Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is true that more and more people use computers, which in sure you're aware of, but is @CAPS3 really nessesary. I use my computer, I used to use @CAPS3 all the time, but then I got into sports like skateboarding and snow boarding so now i got away from @CAPS3. Yet, @CAPS4 are many many people that still use them and i believe that people should really try to stop going on as much because you could start to get big @PERSON1 fat, @CAPS4 are way better thing to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air. First is that @CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @PERSON1 fat, being fat is not a good thing @CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can't help @CAPS3, and i feel really bad for them. I have a few friends that are over weight like @PERSON1, @PERSON1 is a very over weight kid, he was about @NUM1 lbs whe nhe was @NUM2, I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @CAPS2, but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @CAPS3 is terrible, @PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike, nobody would teach him anyways because he doesn't have a father and his mother is over weight as well and as fat as his sister. see her anymore. So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @CAPS3 worse. Next is @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, messing around on the computer all day is like saying in just going to throw my life away. Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @CAPS3 is shopping sports youre still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me. Go for a walk @PERSON1 some thing just try to get yourself dumb, but still fun, computer. I will @CAPS3's fun @CAPS4 are many many thing to do on the computer. Most importantly is that @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air, being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do, you could be walking, be on trampoline, @PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer, even just sitting @CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to got fresh air in your system. Just do something that involves being outside @CAPS3 is so much fun. So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends @PERSON1 your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @CAPS3 is very possible to get fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air.

Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I don’t agree. Saftey, the money, health. Many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried.? They can be asked who they are, were they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she nevered showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the begining. Once your child’s school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that "if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese.” @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your childs school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys alot. I trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then your going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the saftey, money and health. This is very urgent situation so please be aware.

Dear: local newspars @CAPS1 recently been brought my attendchon, that people should use computers. My three arugment are they tach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow People to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 tachs people hand-eye coordination because when people type on the kyebord the more and more ther type on the kyebord and the faster and faster.

Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet.
