I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you.

Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like @LOCATION2, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship.     Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @ORGANIZATION1. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. One public library @MONTH1 be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.     Libraries today @MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout @LOCATION1 in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive.     Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; '@ORGANIZATION2', or '@ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary.     Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies, magazines, should be removed off of the shelves if they are offensive? My personal opinion is that they should not be removed. unless they are so inapropreate that children should not be avle to see.     That is my opinion because if readers go into the library and find an offinsive book to us might not be offinsive to him/her and his/her standards. And if it is offensive to him/her so what he/she is the one checking it out so he/she obviously knos what he/she is getting in to so there for we should not remove books off the shelves if they are offinsive, because offinsive to one is not offinsive to the other. well actually my opinion goes half and half because if the movievs and librarys are inapropreate then aldults should be the only ones to buy them.      That is my personal opinion many others @MONTH1 have different opinions on this subject but i just think every thing should just stay on the shelves. And movies sold to aldults and aldults only.

Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time.  When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to.  Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library.     Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world.  Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books.  If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place.  For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous.  @PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be.  Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section.  Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner.     Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around.  Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall.  Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in?  The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away.  The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library.  Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children.     As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds.  Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain

Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries.      The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.      To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.     When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve.     Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view.     My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone

I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves

I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive.  First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values.           I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself.      I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room. @CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. @PERSON1 looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. @CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man.      As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture. @CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1. @PERSON1 says, ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom takes  me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up.      A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at @PERSON1 and I said, '@CAPS5'd you give that to her?' @CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks' and aids. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father. @CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago. Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson. He should have just left her alone.      So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it

Do I think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive? Yes I do beause why keep it on ther if it's offensive to young kids and other people.     If it dosen't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on ther. Its sertin things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a sepreat section from the kids section.     They shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violents in it because the kids now days have to much violents as it is.The only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it.     So I think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning maertails and things that would persuad them to do some in they life.

There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction. However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items did not. The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. No one can blame the authors. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events. People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.

Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library.     When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc. it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things. For instance, if tweleve year old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems.     Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past. Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer.     Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country.     In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see.

Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that @MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves.     If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people @MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left.      Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors @MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner. Others @MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.     In conclusion, i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left

Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision.

Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life

Censorship in libraries is a very contraversial.  Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it.  Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons.  All people have freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1 and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right.  Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public.  Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government.      First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the @LOCATION1.  If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed.  When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished.  For example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that @CAPS1 wasn't real?  Many @CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries.  Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library.  A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs.     Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowleged by the public.  Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to right about.  There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a  large group of people do not agree with what it says.  In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book.  Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them.  The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged.     Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances.  It just depends in what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things.  The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people.  Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children @MONTH1 appall others.  So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of contraversy.  Once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library.  There should be certain limits though.  For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie.  This is the same age a person must be to get into a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision.  Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person.     Censorship in libraries will always be changing.  Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not.  People of the @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right.  The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves.  Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them.  Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others

Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it band from all local stores? Well I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the sheer distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I personally think that a young adult should be able to read any book or news article that they wish to. The fact that a book is found offensive of offputing to most is no reason to completely ban the book from store and library shelves alike, because if there is @CAPS5 one person that could educationaly benefit from reading this book then they should at least have a chance to obtain that information.      One of the most impotant things to remember while considering this topic is that no matter what the source is or what it conveys there will always be someone that feels the book is just to graphic of hits to close to home for them to stand. In other cases however, there are books that are not proper for younger children or the faint of heart, such as the book series 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which people are thrown into an arena and forced to fight each other for their very lives. Most people who are above the age of twelve can handle almost all of the 'offensive sources' that are atainable by the public, but there are some cases that @CAPS5 adults cannot handle such as the famous  book that @PERSON1 wrote in incarseration called ' @CAPS3 @CAPS4.' @CAPS5 in those extreme cases most adults can the read.      Now that my argument has been said and you know my point of view is that it veries from person to person whether they can handle a book I ask you if feel the same way that I do. My main reason for this conclusion is that if someone thinks a book is too offensive they should simply avoid this book. We do live in @LOCATION1 the land of the free, I think we can a little controversy over a book or magazine. I do hope that in the future we as a nation can overcome these small setbacks that are caused by an over reaction to something offensive. I believe that we will see a day that no book will be band from the shelves, so that our children @MONTH1 gain the knoledge that is contained by thoes fragile pages of paper

I thank that all of the books and movies and more should not  be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see.      They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 want happen again.     The libraries is for freeom to read to do want you want and look up.     In the newspaper and magazines people like to no that happens in the @CAPS1 or to people if its bad or not, because no how that cant happen to them, some people mite thank that people not read watch something but are they to tell what to do they can there own dishens
<START>

I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone

Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading.           I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it. Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.           When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book.              In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge.

Censorship     In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from. Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it.     I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn.      Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't.     With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library
<START>

A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas.      Certain materail @MONTH1 be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair. If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information.     Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed? If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive.     There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people @MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things. Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood.     We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries. That material is the life blood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that. For whoever reads this, remember what we produces as media is who we are, what we do , and what we live for.

Why Censorship @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense.  Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there.  Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen.  We just have to teach our kids what @CAPS1 good and what @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  This goes for literary items too.  We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @CAPS1 right.  I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive.  I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.     Now days, there @CAPS1 a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books.  If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself.  The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece.  They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea.  I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @CAPS1 a person that put a lot of effort into that material.     In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it.  The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @PERSON2 had a wife and had children.  This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @CAPS1 just a story full of conspiracy theories.  You can still believe what you want and read this book.  A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Can't @CAPS8.  Many people hear this title and @MONTH1 not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @CAPS6 people, but instead it @CAPS1 a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball.  Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories.  They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.     In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things.  In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want.  Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this.  If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book.  Even though it @CAPS1 disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book.  There @CAPS1 always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it.  Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.     Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else.  If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left.  We cannot control everything that people do.  Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading.  If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all.  I think that censorship in our libraries would be a @CAPS2 idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries
<START>

Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world
<START>

No I do not belive that certain materials should be removed. I belive that people should be able to have freedom of speech. I also belive that if somebody has something on their mind they should should be able to say it. I all ways tell peolple to mean what you say and say whay you mean. Now if its younger kids getting ahold of magazines and movies with inpropriate material in it then yes it should be censored or they shouldn't be placed in places with younger kids can get to them
<START>

I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries, children don't really know what those offensive things mean.The library is the only good place to find information or to find a book that they enjoy. If you take things that @MONTH1 seem offensive to people; people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they neeed.     People use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library doesn't intentionally insult people. The library just gives us facts  about what we need to know about a person or anything like that. Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that and if they cant be mature about stuff like that then they don't need to be in the library.     I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone but their not so why should the magazines, movies, books, an music be taken out of the library. Thats just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery is an offensive thing to colored people cause the colored people get called names that i will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past.     Honestly I think people will be ok they dont need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive they just need to know that it wasnt intentionaly done
<START>

I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library. It not okay for you too say one thing and something your child found in the library say it okay. what if you were talking to your kids about not smoke and how it bad for them and could potentially kill them, would you like you child to say that i can smoke because all this character in the book are smoking? No that not right it just pure wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazine in the library.     In high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that. Sometimes it might be hard to believe the things your parents talked to you about and how harmful they are to you and your body and would lead you to a trouble life down the road. Movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car. it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen. The media does a bad job of showing teens it not right to do the things they see on tv. The library set a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and think it okay for people to read them and not take it offensive.      I was reading a book that was talking about how they think it okay to act rascist aganist other people and say mean thing and call them bad name. I really took that offensive because i wouldnt like someone calling me name and saying bad things about me because they think it okay to say things like that and act that way. If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem in our hands because some people would take offensive to it and cause a big issue over a small book and some readers might think its okay and cause even a big issue between people who take it offensive and people who dont take it offensive.     There are those people out there who think that it okay for those kind of books to be in the library and other people who think it wrong and offensive. My personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library. We tell people how it wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but it say that in the book that it alright for those thing to be happening or it right to use those foul language. I just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies. music, books,or magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self.
<START>

what i think about all of this? Is that to me i really don't care because that is like who i am. And its up the parents if they want the to remove the books off the shelf if they believe that a certain material as book, music, movies, and magazing should be remove off the shelves. Also i dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean its just a book it dose not really matter.     Next, i am saying this becuse i dont really would get offensive to stuff like this argument. And also if there some stuff that kids shouldnt know about then they should  put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section.     Matter of fats i don't know why they should  remove stuff like movie. Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see they are really dumb to do that. Beause there are moive that children can watch. And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies, and other movie they were not to see at there ages. Unless if their parents allowe it.And that goes with the same with the music. I don't know if they have bad music in the library.I don't see rap stuff in the library.like raps @CAPS2 and other stuff like it.So this is my thought about this arguments
<START>

yes i thinck they should take efence books off the shelf because little likd read the books then they will probley be tought rong from right. And if the books had vilance then they will thinck tkat is right to.

Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities.

Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article? Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.      People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.      Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.      As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.      In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly. Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment? To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.      When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored!

Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school.      Back in elementary school, I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them.     Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world.
<START>

I think as long as the book ain't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it. If its offensive I think they shouln't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing. Also I think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves. Parents or teachers wouldn't want there kids finding out bad words to say
<START>

I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.
<START>

Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive?     I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.     The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.     Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.     So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are.  Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.         I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. That's the end of my conclusion

No, I don't think books are offensive in librarys. Movies are a different kind of story if you child is under the age of eighteen they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie, unless their parent approves of it.      This is one reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While i was in our public library one afternoon I was looking at the movie selection, i was tring to decide which movie to chose. There was a little boy, at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me, but he had two movies in his hand. They looked really good it was an action type movie, so i asked the boy if i could see the movie really fast. He asid yes, so i grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and i told the boy did u know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie and he said yes, I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that, if i was his age i would never been able to.      My second reason why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5,swimsuit magazines and many more. Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our libray for the public to see. If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she not even noticed it. At her age she wants someone to look up to and if she sees a model on or in the magazine she would want to possibly look like her, so this is how eatting disorders start. This is the  reason why library's should get rid of any kind of magazines under that catagory.     These are the reason why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and/or Magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you agree with me contact your libray and tell them what i have told you today. @MONTH1 we put a stop to censorship in our librarys.
<START>

There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books.  This is called censorship.  However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library.  @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good?  This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books.  Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons;  The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.       First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press.  This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today.  If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations.  Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author.  If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves.  It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.      When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds.  This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything.  Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it.  No matter the age they are.  If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning.       A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember.  This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this.  Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years.  When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more.  Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'.  It's no different.  The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge.  An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease.  It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?     All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public.  There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap.  Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law.  If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books.  It would be a scary day if that happened.  For it would not be something that went well in our history.  Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings.  So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them.  Not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be

Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. None persone have right to say this book offended me so should the libraries removed it. If some book offend soome person that dosn't me all the people will offend by this book.My opinion is they should not removed this book, because some people like to read that book. If some one don't like this book and this book offended them.They shold don't read this book and read what they like. but son't say should be removed this book. I think evey one like different books. So should the libraries but every thing the people like read it..
<START>

If everyone in the world could permantly take a book, movie,music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy?      I personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it.     If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people? I dont think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it.     On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then? You can just take that person out of the world.     So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you @MONTH1 not bee the same for others.

The contents of the books in libraries vary in many way. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.      With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?     In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone

If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are

Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.     As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.     I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3. @PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.     All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.

If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it

I myself beleves that censorship in libraries should not be aloud. If their was to be any cersorship it should be from the parents of a child or if your not a child then you dont need censored. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. Just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather.     Think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. Being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books ive learned alot but I feel as if I went to a librarie to get a book and if censored or taken off the shelf then I will shown a fake world. Once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt consor anything else.     A censored book, movie or whatever it @MONTH1 be could also determin how much someone could learn from it. People go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up.     This is some of meny reasons I think cendor in libraries shouldnt be aloud. Consorship should be chosen by who you are not by outher people. In the end we @MONTH1 never know whats better till we try.

No because the writer is explain th way the story really happend.If ur kid ask u the word tell him/her it not a good word to say, r u can take the book back and get him/her a new one.          Say him/her kids comes home from school and say a couse word and u asked him/her were they learned it from. An they said the teacher said it. U can tell the teacher u dont wounting ur him/her reading that book.                                                                Cousing is a way of explain the story better to them i guess.

Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad?      It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.     On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them. So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.     Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things. I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.     Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Now a days @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a @NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that. Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical.      In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine

I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesnt like a book, then they dont have to read it. Books are ment to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's a honest way of making money.

'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing

The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on.     I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing.      Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.    These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you.     There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent.     If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion.     In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things.

How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in

Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2            'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.     Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?     So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?     This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.     There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place

I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned form their children,but not from the public. Everyonehas their owen belief in what he or she reads or rights even watches so the library is perfect the way it is . We can not through out books we find offensive because of our beliefs because somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain relgion or a certain topic. If we through out all the books and made a library with  only the books we wanted we'd be in a lot of debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place. So if we have a problem with a book or movie form the library weshould just keep our children awayfrom that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item

A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things

When I was in seventh grade I had a mission to read every @PERSON1 book I could get my hands on. Some of the material in her books proved to be a little too racy for most middle schoolers and some parents had apparently deemed it inapparopriate and our school librarian had made the decision not to carry it in the school's library. I was devastated, there would be no way my mother would agree to buy me all twenty some odd books that @PERSON1 had written and I didn't have enough money from my meager allowance and various lemonade stands to purchase them myself. Back then, this censorship which banned my favorite books from ever showing their covers in our school's library, bothered me immensely. I couldn't understand why some people's parents @MONTH1 view some of the subject matter in her books as too mature for our age group. However, I am having a change of heart. Now I can understand why our school's library @MONTH1 not be so fond of carrying books with racy aspects to them. That is why I believe that in school libraries, some books should be censored or marked mature. In public libraries though, these books should not be censored.      Books need to be censored in school libraries because some children @MONTH1 be too immature to handle the subject matter within the book's pages. Most parents want their children to stay as innocent as possible for as long as possible and I can respect this idea. Having advanced books would also make the school look bad as not all parents would be on board with the idea and some would complain about their children reading something which they didn't intend them to find out about for many years to come.      Not all censorship has to do with sex. Another type of graphic novel which is often censored is the violent type. The real-time war story which depicts the horrors of fighting for one's country and juxtaposes is with the thought that was is valiant and something to be applauded in the people back home. Some of these stories can get very graphic as to convey the point that war is not all fine and dandy and all it seems cracked up to be. These type of stories are important for our culture to prevent any misconceptions we @MONTH1 have or try to prevent them from a young age by shocking the reader. War should not be perceived as something fun and exciting and young @CAPS1 should know that so when they reach the age of signing up for the military they don't go into it misguided. In these instances, these violent stories are important for our youth to see and I think that they should not be censored in the library.      One @MONTH1 raise the question of these books possibly invoking violence. I am not advocating that books with unecessary violence be put on the shelves. I believe that the books with violence which helps to convey and important point which should not be missed should be displayed by school libraries.      Public libraries are a far different story. They have different sections for children's literature and adult literature. In school libraries the majority if not all of the library is devoted to children or teenagers. While in the public library it is the exact opposite, (unless the case in a children's public library). Most public libraries carry mostly adult books and a small section of children's books. In this type of setting it would be fine to allow any type of book in the adult section, marked mature. The subject matter doesn't really matter but the point of public libraries is to educate our citizens and if what they want to read is violent or sexually explicit then so be it, as long as they are reading at all and using the government funded resources provided for them. If the library was privately owned then the owner could decide to put whatever books they wanted into it and censor whatever books they wanted to.     The purpose of libraries is to educate the citizens of this country and try to better them and help them make clear informed decisions based on their prior knowledge. If the books are censored then some messages might not get conveyed and misinformation @MONTH1 run adrift. We must prevent this at any way possible
<START>

In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for @CAPS4 to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they @MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters.      The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because @CAPS4's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves.     In the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. @CAPS4 should not be changed     @CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that @CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if @CAPS4 has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear.     The song '@CAPS5 You' by @ORGANIZATION1, they replaced the @CAPS6 word with '@CAPS5'. When he wrote this song, he knew that @CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and @CAPS4 is still a good song.     Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if @CAPS4 is too graphic. They @MONTH1 take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @CAPS4 is sold in stores.     I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made @CAPS4 so.

Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library

Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.     True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.     I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.      People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.      All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.
<START>

I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.
<START>

Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them.                                                              @PERSON1

libraries have tons...of books, cd's, movies, and magazines for people to read. they have all kinds for people who have intrest in certain things.and some might be offensive to some people...let me tell you what i think!           Most people like stuff that is interesting to them and some like other things. There are certaint things for people for certaint ages to look at, there kids sections there is a teen section and there is an adult section. there could be some stuff that people will think is offensive. but that doesnt mean they would have to take @CAPS4 off the shelf they @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have to grab @CAPS4. simple as that.     and thats all there is to @CAPS4..and thats what i think about library products like that. and what people should do to not getting stuff that is offensive to them...'@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'!

I for one like books, movies, music, ect., without censoring. Sheltering the younge is not too bright because they'll get curious of things and sometimes they dont tell us they just find out for themselves. Most media and books have things uncensored for many different reasons and I think its going good. Yes there are some youth that take somethings too seriously but thats because the parents are not there to explain. I'm not saying go and show a four year old a rated '@CAPS1' movie but lighten up on somethings.      Music is everywhere it's kind of hard to shelter your kid from music anyways because it's, well everywhere. You should be there to watch what there listening to but they're going to hear it sooner or later, might as well let them hear it around you then some one else that will give them the wrong advice. Some parents complain so much about this subject because they don't want to have to be there all the time to explain everything, but then why have a kid if you can't take that responsibility.      Books are not so different, if a book has certain things that parents dont want their children reading then take it away from them. But most books with that kind of stuff don't have any pictures so they would have to imagine it and if they don't know what is being talked about then they wont be able to think of anything bad anyways. I'm not going to be a careless parent but I don't think sheltering kids from the real world and media and books is a good idea, very unwise.      Kids are going to learn about curse words, drinking, and stuff like drugs someday, it's up to the parents to be there and teach the kid from right and wrong if they have a question from something they heard or watched or read. People worry too much about censoring and making sure everything is clean but media and books are not all clean, never has been 'till some people got lazy and didn't want to be there for their child @PERCENT1.      When I was young my parents didn't shelter me or keep me from reading what I wanted to read, and I turned out fine. I don't drink or do drugs, because my parents were there if I had a question about something I didn't understand in a book or media. It's not the media or literature it's the parents, and if they can't be there to explain then why did they become parents.      And as for magazines, if a parent is really that worried about certain ones around their children then don't let them buy them it's your choice.      Don't you want your kid to get out there and live their own life when they become an adult? Then don't shelter them from everything. Let them find out about stuff when they ask a question. If they read something in a book and don't understand it then either you could tell them whether it's right or wrong or let them find out the bad way, that's your choice. If they see something on @CAPS2 then explain don't just freak out and block them from knowing what's out there in the real world.      It's your choice to make on all that, but if you shelter them too long they'll never have a good life. Sheltering @MONTH1 not seem so bad now but wait 'till they get older and start they're lives, they wont know what to do or how to talk to people right. I've seen it with my own eyes on how bad sheltering kids from media and books can take effect on certain things in a human being's life.     Censoring everything isn't good, the only way to learn anymore these days about real life is media and books. Not cesoring all that will help people see what the world needs to work on. So don't censor everything and let the next generation know what the generation before did wrong.

In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof.  People call these buildings libraries.  Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern.     It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor.       Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information.      I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let  our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german. My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children.     Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect

That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement. I think it is the goverment's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not. So we will need ligitement reason's to take some books off the shelf.     Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like. Some kid's might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we got here to this very continent.     Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what theese parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books. We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world.     When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot. I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more. So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn.     Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good ligitement reason to take it off.

Censorship is a tricky concept. It is a word that can ban music from stores, books from shelves, and movies from theaters. Katherine Paterson, an author, said that if all things reading or listening materials were removed, nothing would be left. I thoroughly agree with that statement. If someone finds one aspect of a work offensive, that does not qualify for the work to be banned or discarded. I believe offensive material should not be removed because of the following reasons: it suppresses the feelings of the author, nothing will be left on the shelves, and there is no defining line on what is or is not offensive.     Now, I understand there is a vast amount of people who are against my position. I assure them that I understand those feelings. Some audiences feel that the removal of offensive material is good because it shields the ears of those who cannot handle the verbage or context. Others @MONTH1 feel that sensitive audiences @MONTH1 not be comfortable with the text. In addtion, many people believe that exposing people to violent, risky, and material with dangerous habits will evoke the same behavior in young children. Though these are all valid opinions, they are not enough to automatically think that it is okay to throw it off the shelves.     Contrary to the opinions of others, I believe one reason @CAPS6 material should be kept on the shelves because if it is not on the shelves, the the thoughts and feelings of the writer will be suppressed. For instance, the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' was banned for a long time. Harper @CAPS3's book, @MONTH1 have had some slurs we @MONTH1 find offensive today. However, that is the way people in that time spoke. Who are we to fault the people of the @DATE1 and @DATE2 for how that articulate words? By banning 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' for the time frame that it was banned, generations were robbed of the powerful and beautiful meaning of the entire book. That meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong. The same for done for @CAPS6 book. @CAPS6 one reason why I believe that should stay on the shelves.     Next, works of literature and music should stay on the shelves because as Katherine Paterson said if everyone removes a book, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 is very true. Many books have been on the banned book list. For instance there is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' '@CAPS9 in the @CAPS10,' '@PERSON2,' and the like. What book will be removed from the shelves next? Once society is relieved of all literature, the next step will be music. Look at the singer/songwriter @PERSON3. He made some very sexually themed music. When people bought his records in the @DATE3, they had to be covered or placed in brown papered bags. They @MONTH1 be considered censorship, but that is one step away from being banned. His record company refused to produce his music under his name because of the scandalous lyrics. Because of that, @PERSON3 has changes his name to an unpronouncable symbol. What will be next?     Finally, my last reason for why offensive material should not be removed is because who is to say whether or not something is offensive? A novel or song @MONTH1 be pleasing to @NUM1 people, but should it be extinguished from the record store or library because of one person? I do not think so. There are many words and concepts that have not be socially accepted of the centuries. However, those same appalling concepts have become accepted if not an uncommon habit.  If @CAPS6 'offensive material' is given time, it will become unoffensive in the years to come.     For all the reasons I have stated, I do not agree with removing anything off the shelves because something finds it to unacceptable if not offensive. If everything is removed because of an opinion, the world of the arts will be no more. Then, we as people will wonder what will be left of us. We will be nothing more than a mass of narrow-minded and ignorant individuals who know nothing about books, music, magazines, movies, etc. Now, I pose @CAPS6 question to you: If all was deemed offensive material, what would be left?

Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others @MONTH1 not. The censorship that I am discussing  is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone.     The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people @MONTH1 never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone.     The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person @MONTH1 enjoy that book and many others @MONTH1 like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to.     The last reason is parents can limit what their children read.If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves.     The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public.  Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.

Some people ask, '@CAPS1 books should be censored from libraries?' @CAPS2 are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about.      It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch. @CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job.      Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. @CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad. On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless.      With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it.      In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. @CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to

Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn.
<START>

At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped

i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.

Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society.      Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader @MONTH1 be offended.     In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship.     For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The @CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs?      These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you @MONTH1 be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one
<START>

I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive. If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs. Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it.     I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs. I think this because, children can read this and then, they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others. Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others.      People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others. It could cause problems for the libraies also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material. Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close.      I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because  alot of people look at them like they are trash. It makes a bad impression on some people. Its rude for it to be there. It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads.     I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf. It can cause many problems with others. It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore. Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way.
<START>

There are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made. But thats their decision and not everyone should listen to it or just try to do it. I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off. They should because it might offend someone and it shouldn't beacuse then people can read or see it or even listen to it if its music and then know more about it and then they might not do the same things. So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too. They might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also.     I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive and you just cant stop all of it. I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school and most of it is rap music. Yes, most of it is ofensive to girls and stuff but thats just music, it doesn't mean its true or anything. People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it. If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just not like it, they have thr right to just avoid it and not look at it. People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world. But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you. You just got to know how to avoid it. Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier then just taking all the time you have to to try to get something banned off of a shelf. You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about. When I read or listen to something thats offensive and I don't like it. I will just turn it off or not read it anymore. Not try to get it banned because that takes to much time. People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned becuase another book will be out again and it will be the same.     So as you can see I think the material that is written should just stay as it is and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not. If they do and they think its offensive then thats their fault for reading it when they know its gonna offend them. And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them. So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned. So nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same. We might not want our kids to read something bad but they will one day so why not just get it done and over with in the benginging.

Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it.

There are thousands of libraries throughout the world. All of which are filled with numberous books, magazines, music, movies, ect. for people of all ages to obtain. Some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there. I do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research.     Materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. Everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropiate or not. If one person were to decide a book was unappropiate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was unappropiate off the shelf as well. However, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropiate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease.The same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, ect.     Another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. A fifty year old man would not have the same intrests as a thirteen year old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to chose from. If there is a little variety to chose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it.      Lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. A child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder women could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home cooked meal. Both people would need a material from the library to help them with their reasearch, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them.     Materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. Some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but I strongly disagree. There are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay

In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.

Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they @MONTH1 even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offesive language and not so well of pictures. They @MONTH1 be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive.      Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.     On @DATE1, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. @CAPS2 is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosuars, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. @CAPS2 was very into reading. He  read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed. We were walking down @CAPS1 street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees. 'ekkkk!' said @CAPS2 as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for @CAPS2. @CAPS2 and I walk up stairs to the childrens section. @CAPS2 is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine. i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared. He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. '@CAPS3 stay calm.' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that @CAPS2 had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section. She said 'oh my!' @CAPS2 laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home.

Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.

Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored.      An idea that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensice to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion @MONTH1 believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to someone of @CAPS2 religion, and because of that the @CAPS1 would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another.     If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors @MONTH1 say forget it and not even right anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored.     If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me @MONTH1 find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored.     A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.

Recently the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunent in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way.     History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of want we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorent of facts.     I realise that there are some things chilldren should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or latter they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected for some things? Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the induvidual parent to protect their child. Protect the children but don't do so at the expence of everyone else.     Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would persume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected for natural, form history, or from their own desires have no more right, and preahaps even less than everyone else to interfere with induvidual decision making. People have a right to make their own choices on what them believe but no right to force those oppinions on others.       This essay @MONTH1 make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served it's purpose. With that task completed I can finnish with a good concious.

I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off.  You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice.      Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers.     I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion.      Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them.     In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. Its just apart of life
<START>

Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.     I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.      Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read.     Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about.

Dear @ORGANIZATION1 ,           I dissagre with removing materials from the library. I personally do not think it is the libraries fault if someone is offened by books, movies , music or magazines etc. If they did not like the book or movie it is their fault for picking it in the first place. Children who are under the age of thirteen should not be able to watch movies that are not for them , they should not be seeing those bad movies or scary movies at such a young age.     I  want the libraries to think this over ; because it is not fair to adults or older children. Movies that are funny entertain children daily ; some children even quote movies and make other children laugh. I know for a fact us teens watch funny movies to make our rough day turn into a better day , well that is what I do at least. There are some movies out there that are just so funny , I could quote ever line of it.     Music on the other hand is very important to teens these days. It is always enjoyable to me. I love music without it I'm not quite sure where I would be in this world. I love many  different kinds of music , most of it is very fun to listen to. I'm not a big fan of rock , you would not see me picking that up from the library.Us teens love music , we use music for pretty much everything. We dance to it , sing to it , workout to it , and most of all we just enjoy it.      Books are always important , even though I do not like to read that often I still like to read books that interest me. For example you would not see me reading a scary book , because it would just remind me of the movie , and I would have nightmares. The books that interest me the most are fiction books. My two favorite books are A @CAPS1 To @CAPS2, and The @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Both of those books are by the author @PERSON1. I love all of his books but these ones are the best.      Please re think your decission about getting rid of the bad music , books , and  movies. @CAPS2 it is not the libraries fault it is the people who are borrowing them. If they do not like it then they should have never taken it home in the first place. I say we just let it be, and let people be happy

There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age.     The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.     My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not.       My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them

Many people base their actions on their own views. What @MONTH1 appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for @CAPS8 viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2.                First up, books in the library. Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others @MONTH1 enjoy it, whether they share your views or @CAPS7.           People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as @LOCATION1 citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should @CAPS7 be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I @MONTH1 learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.           With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, and it is a right garunteed to us, as @CAPS5 citizens, under the @CAPS6. And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might @CAPS7, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, @MONTH1 @CAPS7 be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.          People should @CAPS7 take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should @CAPS7 ruin the experience by marking the words out. @CAPS7 only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should @CAPS7 be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in @CAPS8 libraries, the @CAPS8 should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, @CAPS7 limited

Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive.  All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books.  Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them.  So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader.     These books that are considered offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.  For example, @PERSON2, who is from the @CAPS1, comes into a library and finds a book that is all about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and she reads that the @CAPS1 is full of a bunch of people who mistreated their slaves.  @PERSON2 gets a @CAPS5 offended by this. Then @CAPS5 @PERSON3, who is an @CAPS6 @CAPS7, picks up the same book and reads all about the @CAPS1 and how they treated their slaves.  @CAPS5 @PERSON3 thinks that the same book that @PERSON2 hated is a great book.  As shown in the example, @LOCATION2's people are very diverse, but what comes with that diversity is a lot of opposing views in its citizens.  A library doesn't want to only appeal to one race, it wants to appeal to all of them, the only way to have that happen is to accidently offend some people in the process.  The citizens of the @LOCATION1 need to be more understanding that their race isn't the only one here.  If a book offends a person, that person simply should not read it.  However, these books, who many @MONTH1 find offensive, could also be beneficial to its readers.     Some of these books could be helpful to the people who choose to read it.  Going back to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 reference, @PERSON2 was reading her @LOCATION3 @CAPS11 text book, and she read about the horrible deeds the @CAPS1 had done regarding their slaves and the fact that they lost the @CAPS3 to the @ORGANIZATION1, and she got offended because her side lost.  Then @CAPS5 @PERSON4, who is in the same class as @PERSON2, was reading his history text book and was becoming more and more elated as he read on.  He found out that kids all over the the country were learning about what had happened to his ancestors and that the @ORGANIZATION1 defeated the @CAPS1.  @PERSON3 was as happy as he could be with this book, whereas @PERSON2 couldn't be any more displeased.  If this book was pitched out of the library, how would students all over the nation learn of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? They wouldn't.     Libraries cannot just throw out books because they offend someone.  As Katherine Paterson said, if we all picked a pile of books that offend us and got rid of them, then there wouldn't be any books left for any of us to read because other nations would be offended by the books that appealed to one, and so on and so forth.  So, libraries need to keep the books that they have and get even more books.  This nation needs as many books as it can get because they are all extremely helpful to those that they appeal to.  We just need to remember that not all of the books appeal to us and not to get offended by those that don't.

Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,      @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      @PERSON1

I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child
<START>

I'm writing this paper today to talk about cenorship of books, movies, music,etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the self that childern can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less
<START>

How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, '@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2'? Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn.                             Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries.                             Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it.                                                                      In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and  struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime

Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places.     Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it.     When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music.     Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter.     Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys.      But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke

If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.     First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. To most @CAPS1 cultures, declining food is offensive. To @CAPS2, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it @MONTH1 be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone.      Second, one of the best thing's about the @LOCATION1 is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal.     Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a @CAPS3 cover with a pentgram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do. I @MONTH1 be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group @ORGANIZATION1 is greatly offended when they see the @CAPS4 flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.      I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many thigs offensive. It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what @CAPS5 was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people

Durning school one day all of our teachers told the class that most of the books in the libary is going to be took off the shelves. But our class don't want that to happen. All the teachers told us that some people parents has been complaning about what there kids are reading. I thank that most the the books that are in the libary is good for the kids to look at because thats what they like annd they like to learn about what would like to have or do someday. I also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life. Later in life when I have kids I would like them to dream about what they want to do in there life. So if that means that they want to go to school and look at magazines all day and make sure that thats what he wants to do thats fine with me.     So if the teachers want the books off the shelves they can but I don't think that the kids are going to try much if they cant be what they want to be later in there life time. I know that if they did that to my kids that I know I would buy them all the magazines thay want so they can learn what they want to do in life. So if they take all the books off the shelves I know that all the kids parents are probley going to get mad because thats what messes up the kids dreams.     Know when the kids what to read the schools is taking all the good books off the shelves none of the kids are going to know what they want to do in there later life. A good thing to do is to let the studends vote and see what the what to do about taking the books off the shelves. I bet most of the students in this world would say to keep them on the shelves because they like to read and look at pictures. That means that they want to be something when they grow up. I hope that my kid whats to be something that he likes to do when he grows up. I will help any kid as much as I can with there dreams.     There is two things that are going to happen. One is that the school is going to take the books off the shelves and the students are not doing to try in school and they might not know what they want to be. Or they might just give up on it all. And I know that know one whats that to happen. The second thing is that the schools is going to keep the books on the shelves and the students are going to want to read them more. Also they will probley know want whey want to do later in there life time. If I could pick what to do I would keep the books on the shelves and make the kid happy

Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines

I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish
<START>

Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.

Have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books? Well, I know I have. There are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of. I believe censorship should be allowed in libraries, because the censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life without books about violence, another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children, but the social lives of everyone, and the overrated music of our generation.     My reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways, but I would like to view it in my way. Look around, are their little children around. Well, if there is I would be looking at what they are reading or doing. The children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age. Take for example, a child that is six years old, and can do whatever he or she wants. They have no limits. So, one day the child decides I am going to check out a book at the library. The child obtains a book that is about violence and sex. What does the parent do when that child brings that book home? Nothing. The parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child. The time is now to step up to the plate, librarians. Take a stand and censor those books. This is what could happen to anyones child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up.      Children aren't the only ones that are harmed by this deadly disease called noncensored books. Think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place. What are the conversations mostly about? I would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence. How do these conversations come up? Well, the only reason is uncensored books at the library. Anyone can check out a book at the library. It could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers. When I was little, my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something. What if the library didn't have censored books, what would I be reading? Social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material.      Lastly, why is that everyone time I turn on the radio, there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to. I listen to the radio station @NUM1 sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence. Guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station. At the library, there is a music section, movie section, and lastly the books. All of that material combined can create a social disaster, if the material isn't censored. I believe that censored music is the best path to go, because our world wouldn't be obsessed with violence if they have never read or learned about it.      Why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library? Take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books. A library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings. It is not a place for violence, so quit with it, go for a safer environment. No one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books, and music
<START>

'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.     In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property. Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessaarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.     The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.     Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling. If you could please take the information i have given you and think about it, it would be greatly appreciated

I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone
<START>

People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What @MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          What might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @MONTH1 have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is

Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content.         Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people @MONTH1 find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library.           Many books that people find as explicit content to them, @MONTH1 not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns.            Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents @MONTH1 not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music @MONTH1 be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.            In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines,  music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone @MONTH1 find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the conten

Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too?     Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In @CAPS1 case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text.      Should 'person one' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible.      Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material.      Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median.      Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them. Again, the happy-median.     For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material

Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past

New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3     Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3. This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission.     Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself.      I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot. People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or parent signature. So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3! Thank you for your time.

Censorships in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion. stoping readers from being able to express their mind.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job. So dont take away readrs imagintion

There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.     When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.      If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.      A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.

Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored.

Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.      Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too.      It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults.      So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.     Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection
<START>

It seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in today's world.  In magazines, in books, in the lyrics of music, the possibilities of where to sneak in offensive references are endless, and they certainly pop up everywhere these days.  But should your resources of where you find these materials be limited due to other people's morals or values?  I disagree with this act, and I would like to tell you why I do.     All of us have different morals, values, and sences of what is right and what is wrong; everyone's are different.  Maybe it's your religion or culture that keep you from these materials.  But why should your values and beliefs dictate what another person can or cannot get from their library?  I know I don't just speak for myself when I say I would be very annoyed if I couldn't get the books or materials I wanted or needed just because the person next to me doesn't agree with what is being found through researching it.  I do believe certain things should be seperated from other parts of the libraries.  For example, books that would be found offensive to children should be kept away from where children can pick out things in a library.  That is completely understandable.  But when things are being removed because certain peolpe don't agree with them or find them offensive, that is when things are going too far.  This nation was built on the grounds of freedom for what you believe in.  So why should we force others to believe something we think?  Just because I find something offensive, doesn't mean the person next to me does, which is completely fine with me.  That is his or her own personal opinion, and what I believe should not keep him or her from learning about the things they would like to.  One way to fix this problem would be to seperate things that could possibly be found offensive into another section of the library and to put out a sign or paper saying what exactly can be found in that section.     In conclusion, no, I do not think libraries should be censored.  I know I could walk into my local library and find things I found offensive right now, but I would not want my own opinion to effect someone else's viewing of that material.  People should think about one another once in a while and not be so stuck on what they personally believe.  The world is an opinionated place, if it were not we would have nothing.  A library can be filled with usful materials, so the focus should be on what you can find in a library to help you, not on what is in the library that you do not want to see.  If you find something offensive, simply stay away from it, but don't try to take it away from the rest of the world.
<START>

Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there.     First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all.     Second, its a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future.     Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it.     I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life
<START>

I think that a cencorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds that are basing the cencorship are very opinionated and biased ones. Two readers of one book could view the material compleately differently.      The reader has chosen to read that book, and thus more than likely know what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the summary on the back. People can make their own decisions, and can therefor choose wether or not to read the book to begin with. The books that would be found innapropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature. If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading.      Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with @CAPS1 adult when checking out books anyway. The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of it's self. The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material is surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered inuendos thoughout the plot.      The material that @MONTH1 be found innapropriate or offensive @MONTH1 be viewed differently given two different audiences. A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls durring passing; @CAPS1 adult that is worring about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough thoughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away. The material being called offensive just because of one person's views in not rite. The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepair us for our futures. A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make shure it could be prevented.      Should the foul things in life be ignored? Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell? The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing?      I believe that these are the stories that need told the most, in @CAPS1 attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life. There will always be things that we wish not to see in life. But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are. The libraries should not be put on a cencorship, but open to the public that wish to dive in to these stories. Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose @MONTH1 just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks  they are alone in these strifes that they are not
<START>

I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves. And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else

BOOKSDear @PERSON1,@CAPS1 @CAPS2 staring to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get does maganzines away or etc, and my last thing is @CAPS4 do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them.The first example @CAPS2 giving is I founded some books and other things that I search being offensive for kids. And the libraries letting kids read them without an I.D because they are for adults reading sections. These books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to them. They should pbs books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time.The second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of. Parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve. Or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books.The last example is @CAPS4 do libraries let kids take them home and read them.They should what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things. Adults need to see what there kids read this days. Kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age.The conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better. So please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days. Like for me I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things.

In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries.I think that people are smart enough to make their  decisions on what they want to read. Their are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why i think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is becuase it's showing disobedience. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole enviroment of a library.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude. If people use profanity at home im a strong beleaver on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious it'll drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming. That'll make the library much flow by easier.     At the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments etc. And finally i think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can controll it

I do belive that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see. They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in. They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy. I know i dont.     Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that. It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home.     Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read. Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time.     So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it.
<START>

Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.      Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.     That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.     At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better.

The library is known to be a place full of dreams and imagination. For some, the library is a sanction where you can escape reality and dive into a book where anything is possible. the library is full of many books for all ages. Therefore, books that are classified for one age group, @MONTH1 not be appropriate for another age group. This is where a problem occurs. If the library chooses to keep books in it that are only appropriate for certain ages groups, various problems can occur. The three main issues with this situation are young children can access magazines they have no buissness looking at, some articles or books can be found offensive to some races creating an uproar, and also events and instances played out in books @MONTH1 not be appropriate for all age groups.We have to think about books we have read, and contemplate if we would want others to read it as well.     Young children are often daily visitors of the library. Most run aroud the library getting into any and all books or magazines the happent to come across. This is not always good. Int he library there are many magazines that are meant for adult eyes only. My family has had an experiance with this sort of situation before. My mother , brother, and myself visited the library one evening. While my mother and I searched the library chaotically, my younger brother found hisself, searching the magazine rack for something to keep his mind occupied. Well his mission was accomplished. On his search my younger brother had found himself a sports illustrated magazine. Inside there were pictures revealed that my mother was not to happy about my brother seeing. Instances like this happy everyday int he local library. staff members should think to put revealing works up to where the younger generation can not find them.      Throughout the library, there are many books dealing with past historic events. Although many find these books helpful and interesting, some find these books to be quite offensive.ome races have undergone painful events in history. Many of those people do not want to relive the painful past experiances. It is in my opinion that the library should oblige by the people, and take in reference how different people feel about certain books. When i was a young girl in elementary school, I remember doing a whole unit on slavery and the underground railroad. While studing the unit, we were assigned a research assignment over the lesson. I choose to visit the library in search for books I could use to gather more information. While searching the library, I came across a book that my mother and I felt should not of been where younger people could see. the book enclosed many horrible acts against black people. This is a book that at my age, I should of never came across.      For me reading books helps me escape the real world and catch a break. When I relax and enjoy a good book, I can't help but feel like nothing inthe world can touch me. Although I love reading books, I don't like when I come begin reading a book then have to hault because the book reveals events that I shouldn't be reading. One book I read, was definitley not appropriate for me. Although I found the book , in the young adult section, the book I read revealed a young girl encoutering many rapes and beatings. Now that I look back , that is a book that i might enjoy now, @NUM1 years later, but I don't feel i should have encountered that book then.      What books should and shouldn't be encountered in the library is surely a never ending feud. Many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences. I think that if the inappropriate books that should not be viewed by all ages, were put away to where the younger audience couldn't get them, then the never ending feud might be able to be put to rest

Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe they should be, but that is my opinion.     It is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it? Music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as; racism, murders, innopropriate language, etc. When we find materials, like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them. We ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive.      Movies and books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we right essays over those topics. It would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there. One hundred percent of factual books is correct. You will have no worries then.     Therefore, I do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed. It is a pointless task to do. Children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also.

Censorship in Libraries      I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Just because some people think it's offensive doesnt't mean all people think it's offensive. Some people @MONTH1 like the content it shows.        I think that things in a library shouldn't be removed because everyone has their own point of view. If something was removed every time someone would walk in, then there would be no library. A library is supposed to be a variety of books. It is not supposed to be just one genre that only one person likes.        It is important to offer alot of variety because if a library doesn't have alot of variety, then the library would lose all kinds of customers. A library doesn't want to target just kids or teen through aduts. The library wants to target all aspects of people. Even if it means that some content is innapropriate. All books are innapropiate if you look at them in the wrong way.       I think that things found in the library that people find offensive shouldn't be removed. Everyone has their own point of view. A library should have a variety of books. Not just one genre a person wants.

Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read @CAPS3, you deamed @CAPS3 as innoproprate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries. I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles.     This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1. There are  too many options, like when @CAPS3 comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as innoproprate, then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better.     One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out. She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait untill I was older. @CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very innoproprate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them.     Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3, or have their childen listen to @CAPS3, then @CAPS3 was their own personal choice.      I do not belive that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. @CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes.

I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs. If you find something offensive then dont pick it up, its that simple. You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to you own personal opinion.     Sure, there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that persons study.      I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way.     There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch.     In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights

Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship. From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart. Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue.      The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race. The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs.     I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles. The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v. I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults

Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree.  She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.'  If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there @MONTH1 not be anything left for people to read.     Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned.  Many people have different views on what is right and wrong.  Some @MONTH1 suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others @MONTH1 be offended by a different book.  If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there @MONTH1 come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent.     Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students.  Books often allow students to think in different, new ways.  They can learn from a new point of view.  Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing.  If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher.  They @MONTH1 suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right.     While removing books for reading @MONTH1 be going to far, things such as movies could go the other direction.  Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them.  I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do.  Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing.  If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be apalled at the cover as they pass.     Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned.  Although other things @MONTH1 have affects on youth, books are a different story.  They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions.  They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering.

First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent.  However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.

There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music

There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varities. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a  lot of things that intrest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listing, reading, or watching. So many people are diferent and each person likes something diferent from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelfs because they're offensive?'     From experince, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong.  I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magaizine that was not there age group, but @CAPS1 that children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age.     As a  parent or legal gardian, most children look up to you. @CAPS1 you read, listin, or watch something that is not to there age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to there parents or legal gardian. They want to @CAPS1 do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find soemthing that is similar to what you doing. They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not there age group. They will do this all because @CAPS1 they want to be just like there parents or gardian. So as a parent or gardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or ect..           There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning enviroment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff.     There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varities they carry. Have you ever thought though, '@CAPS1 its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varities?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you @CAPS1 not think is right. Think about how @CAPS1 someone @CAPS1 really likes that. We all need to except things if we like it or not at times. Just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive

Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their on thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else.      Materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right.       Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about.       Music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive. Most people have there own type of everything.     Children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run. Keep you kids safe is inpormant I understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else.      I could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, But of time your going to have offensive come up in your life. That means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it.      Things get under people skin to easy. This is why the world don't get along. If you don't like something don't me around it. Fine something unless to read about. Thats what I do if I don't like something.

Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. So, do we remove these things or let them stay?     My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will.     People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people @MONTH1 find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less.      Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it.     So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with

Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @CAPS1  finds offensive. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in @MONTH1 not be the right thing in another familys view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated @CAPS2 movies. If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies. What my family believes @MONTH1 not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @CAPS1 has to follow

Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves

All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have.     As humans it is not easy to understand othe people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that extrangers from us can apport.     A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching.     If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library.     Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids. I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch.

Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.

Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken.     I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the @LOCATION1 they should remove material.     Another simple fact is that the constitution @LOCATION1 that we have the freedom of @CAPS1, which basically means we @MONTH1 print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas.     The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic.     So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of the @CAPS1 is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @MONTH1 be assumed 'offensive'.

Have you ever found books, movies, music, and magazines that are about drugs, sexuality, and violence?      I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs, sesuality, and violence. There are many reasons why I think that those books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries. One reason is because little kids can get ahold of the book, the kind of music, the movie, and the kind of magazine that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence then they can learn how to do those kinds of things.     A second reason why I think that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because I feel like a library is not a place to have those kinds of books, magazines, that kind of music, or that kind of movies for parents and their kids to read about and to watch, or even to listen to music that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence.     The third reason why I believe that they should be removed form the shelves of libraries is because thoes kinds of materials belong in another building, a building that is far away form children and only certain people can get into the building and look at the books, magazines, watch the movies, and listen to music that contians that kind of stuff.      The last reason why I believe that they should be removed is because from experience, one time I found a book about drugs I looked at it but it was very unappropate for little kids to look at, it had pictures of what drugs look like, what certain durgs can do to the body.     In conclusin I hope who ever is reading this that you realize what these books, moveis, music, and magazines are doing to the people that are reading them, watching them, and listening to them

There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.
<START>

I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.
<START>

When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking.     When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be.      Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material.     There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people

Yes because children should not be reading anything thats is like that. Children snhould be reading a book that haves good information in there and information the children should be learning while they are in class. Well if the books, music and other stuff to read and look have bad stuff in it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. Some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that. Also movies that have inapproriate scenes in it should be watched by children becaus eits not good for the children to see all that and parents should do something about if their children is watching movies with inapprroiate scenes in it and magazines that have inapproiate pictures because children are too young to see that.
<START>

My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.
<START>

I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it
<START>

I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children.     The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area. If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere.     To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there. I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book.     Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip

Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion it is but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frenquently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc. that are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives. If we @CAPS9't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways.     I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out.      If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc. we could use a rating just like movies do. When a child whom is @NUM1 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM2, and @CAPS3. I think ages @NUM3 are for the @CAPS1-@CAPS2, the ages @NUM4 are for the @NUM2 and ages @NUM6 and up for rated @CAPS3.      I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc. that make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the @CAPS7,  '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9't wait until you have forgotten, call now.

Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen.     Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around.     This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not.     As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future.      Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to.     People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it

People see libraries as a good place for knowlodge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread of the fact of hearing the word, '@CAPS1'. To be honust I only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information now days but; Can some information from libraries be offencive to others? The answer is based by your own opinion to be quite honust, but yes I think some iformation that can be picked up from your local @CAPS1 can be rather, disturbing 'per say'.  Theres books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again thats everywhere.     Now music and movies etc. is sort of the same way, some @MONTH1 not agree with what he/she picks out and you know they might be interested in. Can it be offencive to people? The answer is of coarse it can, but because people will be people. You @MONTH1 not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is titled to their opinion on anything, well normally. Now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son/daughter can just grab, I could see that as a major issue.     Some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in america your child will hear or see those things, it's life. If that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I do'nt nessasarily think it should be banned from the @CAPS1. I believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach to a five year old. These are common arguements people have, about many places and about simular disagreements.      Yes, I agree some things found in a @CAPS1 can be found offencive to some but my answer stays as, 'No' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offencive. If there is something that offencive in the @CAPS1 and mutiple people find it offencive in the community, I would take it to the people in charge of the local @CAPS1

I think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          If you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.It is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some @CAPS1.Vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    A porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe.

Libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies.           Libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, library material should be a choice

Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.      What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.      I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.      I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.      In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material

Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2

They need to remove the bookstors because all studeds wants that the library have many books like spanish books or the diffrent culture, and the students can knows diffrent languges or that they can do many this with that books.  Like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words.                                                                                      And also the music and movies they need to remove because     some dvds are spokeds thats they need to remove.      For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took, and the people can takes the book without pay nothing, thats the people want that the librarys are free.  Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds,  magazines, etc.   Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the   librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world....  I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place, like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place. would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea. And the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read.

Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world

Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people @MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there

Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it? My opinion is no, actually heck no! Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored. The bad thing is that  I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposidly shouldn't be seeing.      One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily bases? Half of the time the statues are of a naked person. I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not. We are in the time period were people are open that it doesn't bother them to see that stuff. Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school.      Someone @MONTH1 have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if its so offisive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it. Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but thats there opinion and that doesn't make them always right. That person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion. Does that make them wrong? You will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right.      Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own. So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it. It is our choice, why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot.      I still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material. Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries. Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves, we are learning how to be more adult like, right?

@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away

Isn't  it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults.      Some music @MONTH1 contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip/hop and rap @MONTH1 contain degrading comments to men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. Music @MONTH1 also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain. I was reading a book called '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', that i had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie.     I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines is a big one. Some magazines @MONTH1 contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to.     Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading.
<START>

All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover
<START>

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.      Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.      If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to @LOCATION1 with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to.       The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1.Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms?  If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship

When one person is giving a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing. But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something.          I belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf. And they shouldn't be romoved if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offence in it.          I also belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a pupose to it. And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published than, it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive.     I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way. But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movie and songs that most people would say its 'junk'. I don't have alot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs, movies that are offensive to even me, I belive that there was some kind of good message there.     I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a peice of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf. Because everything has some kind of purpose to it, and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover

Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.
<START>

I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries. If you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech. This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says. Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it.     I remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books. None of these books really seemed offensive. Then again, this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful' books were at. For example, some adult books etc. These books were offensive. They should not be banned though, they should only be moved.      On a different akasion, i remember walking threw the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at skool and i seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines. I belive that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of site of kids and teenagers.      Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish. I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like. Instead, moved from one area to a different area. For example, instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get there hands on, they should be at a higher level or behind the desk.
<START>

Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has opinions, what would be left without books?     At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford cerain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this system.      If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring?     In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries is they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is titled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go?
<START>

I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves
<START>

Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provide a haven where the can get there hands on such things only and no where else, so shouldn't try to take away any of these things from any body.     One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelfs is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feels differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person own choice, which is something we all should strieve not to do. Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother.     Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even weather people realize it or not, and the more oppuntunties a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has infact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decide that the public should not be educate or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a socity that in situration should not hinder a persons ability to learn.     Also I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's is where parents come in. It's there resoponsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone elses. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parents choice as long as it is in aggrement with the law.      These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decided what materials and subjects are put on their shelfs. For some dicsion no one can make to satify everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves.
<START>

I do not beleive that certain materials such as books, music,, movies, magazines and ect. should be remove, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But i think we should have anything, that teaches you something in the labrary. plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission.     The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think its unnessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be @NUM1 or older or have an adult with you. plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess, so they cant look up things easly. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they dont that sucks. So thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves.
<START>

People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to

Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 it @MONTH1 concerm;             I'm writing you to explain that @MONTH1 students are tired of students in their school not returning books to their schoollibrary. Many students have report due on a book that a fellow classmate didn't return. Many students either forget they have a book out or even past due. So it makes it hard upon the student who is trying to do a report. If the books, music, magazines and etc., are not return people should have to be punished more than just having to pay a overdue fee.     I have witnesses alot of students who didn't either want to turn in the book thr checked out. We the junior class at my high school had a term paper that we need books, newspaper, internet and magazines. Lucky, The senior class turned in all of their book, newspaper, internet, magazines and etc., that they used on their term papers, we the junior class were able to sucess on our term paper. But many juniors still havent reutrn the materials they have used.The teachers have threqten them with overdue fees and or have to pay for the losted material. I see that having to pay an overdue fee and or have to pay for the losted materials doesn't bother them.      Even though teachers makes them pay the future classes will have to struggle and go out and purchase books, magazines, and etc., The classes that have to take @CAPS4 @NUM1 next year and do their term paper @MONTH1 not be able to sucess. It is unfair they have to worry will have the materials they need for them to sucess and do their term paper.      I think if the schools took time out and got parnets involed. They would n't have as many students would didn't follow rules. students think that their teachers can't tell them what to so maybe if their parnets were involes they would follow directions and turn in their books, magazines and etc.,     In conclusion, If someone wants to take a book they should get alot of their personal infornmation as well as their school name.If people dont return their books their want be any thing left for other people to use.So i say everybody do have the right to use the books, music, movies magazine and etc. to their adventage. Just try to remember to return them for other students as well.

No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it.     If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have an option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it. There's no need to discrimanate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it.     It's an public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public which means people of differenrent races, beliefs, religions etc., is going to come through and it's a possibilty that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoreing it.     The choice is theirs to either let someone elses's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negetivity and keep doing thier thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or have hateful things to say about you or your perticular. Don't pay them no mind at all.     I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended but they don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like. Even peoplr that @MONTH1 have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other peoples opinions bring you down
<START>

I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves
<START>

There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance.     Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance. Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about. Watch at least one or two episodes of television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first.     Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs. If this is the case then just ignore it. If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it.      In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance. They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive. That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned.

For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb

Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today

There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive.  Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading.  I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story.  No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it.  You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc.     The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive.  When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life.  I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored.  Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time.  When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials?     The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive.  There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them.  Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice.  It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.  Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement.  Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored.  What would those books be without those statements?     To conclude @CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship.  Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people.  Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are. We @MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about @CAPS1 topic.  We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.
<START>

Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials.

Any one has the right to anything. Right to speak freely; to watch what they please; and so on. The censorship on the media depends. People who like that sort of thing can go to a place where they can buy censorship and un censoredship items. Every place these days has censored books, cd's, video games, ect. But then they also have uncensored items. For those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf.      Also on @CAPS1 parents complain about whats on @CAPS1, well there is a channel button and you can change the channel. Or even in todays technology you can block that channel from ever being watched.     No body ever said that they had to buy what the person in front of you is buying. People have the right to chose what they want to buy, wheather its censored or not. Say or do as they please as long as it's with in the rights of laws.     Its all about your style and what you let your child see. @CAPS3, @CAPS3. Its not as easy to keep children from the volgure things in the new technology. They go to a friends house and that childs parents don't care and let there child watch anything from @CAPS4-@CAPS5 rated. The most you let your child watch is @NUM1.     Its hard to keep a child sheltered from what you'd perfer them not to see. But what people have to realise is that there going to find out one way or another.      Also a child who is sheltered will go to the extremes to find out whats on the other side of the railroad tracks to get a taste of the water, to see what they have been missing out on.     Childeren will be childeren and they will sneak behind your back and do what they want to because they never knew what it was like in the first place.     Any one has the right to anything, you as a person chose not to allow your child you have a @NUM2 year old rated game, but his @NUM3 year old friend does have it. Remeber hes going to play it at his friends house.      Everybody has a different taste on censoreship. Some think everything should be a little cleaner others think different. So thanks to both sides, stores sell to you what you perfer.

@CAPS1 is the freedom of speech to be able to read, right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.I think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf. Like I said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen. But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone. we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country. such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth. Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch. From these things @CAPS1 shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people @CAPS1 is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day @CAPS1 could effect you.

People should not take all the books out for the librarie. Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also.  If people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .So  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at. So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time . That would help to kept all the books in the liberary.      So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out. So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time. And how long you can have the books for . If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged. The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in. Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount. So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.     About the Book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary.   All the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves. Because if you take out one you should take out all off them. Beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves.     So if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did. If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read.     So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine.

I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where its just kids books but when the kids go with their parents or someone that is older up to the teenager and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they dont know what they are looking at when they just pick up a random book off of the shelf and/or rack.      Some people @MONTH1 think that it shouldn't be like that because they are weary of who might see them go into a little room marked @CAPS1 @CAPS2. However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room you just simply don't go in it.      So by secluding the @CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc. you can keep the children from just picking up any book that has uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that the parents @MONTH1 not look at and end up being an @CAPS1 film and then the kid then might want to keep seeing the stuff like that when he reaches puberty he will be eager to have sexual entercourse with a boy/girl.      Having said that, i hope that you see how my idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff will keep them out of the @CAPS1 stuff and keep them from having sexual entercourse at as early of an age as thirteen.     As far as music goes, there really isn't a way to completely keep kids from listening to music such as rap that has foul language and it sometimes talks about having sex and drugs and the kids think that the artist who wrote the song made it to be a big shot and they did drugs and had sex and look how they turned out. The best way, in my eyes, to keep kids from listening to rap is for their parents to not let them listen to it while they are with them. However, the other music like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 or even hip-hop rarely has any references to the topics of rap music.      I could also argue that parents should watch out for their kids to be aware of the consequences of some of the actions they take due to these reasons and they should take the action of diciplining the kids for their actions

'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution

Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it, but some other people @MONTH1. Also somebody @MONTH1 like the scary mystery books and movies, but others @MONTH1 not. I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable.     I can understand why some people @MONTH1 want to remove some movies or books from the libraries. They want to because they are inappropriate, but the thing is, they are not inappropriate to everyone. A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book.      Personally I think that some magizines need to just stop being made. For example; @CAPS1 magizines are horrible to me. There is nothing but nude women in there. I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions. Others @MONTH1 think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magizines, and it isn't jus magizines it's movies also. More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies.     Everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want. I think if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or a magizine don't read or watch it

Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as eachother. What might be offenses to you, @MONTH1 be enjoyable to someone else.      I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.      I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely.      More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.      So I believe that no books should be removed from library's. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont

What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.
<START>

The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored. I believe that libraries shouldnt have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then thats how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a Right in the @CAPS1. If you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word. That isnt up to the public to make a decision.         Its almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the @ORGANIZATION1. If any word is changed it is a incorrect @ORGANIZATION1. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword whats been written.     Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or dont read it

First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries

One person's strong negative opinion effects everyone else.  That doesn't seem logical or fair.  A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres.  There is a book for everyone in the library; it's a matter of finding it.  Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privaledge away from everyone else.     Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read.  Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some @MONTH1 even find the books relatable.  For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there @MONTH1 be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it.  People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach.  One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's.     The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for it's quality, hence the numerous awards won.  Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life.  Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 classes.  It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style.  If all readers were able to look past the surface amoung these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal.  One person's negative interpretation of a novel effects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries.     Readers are fully warned beforhand of the maturity of the contents.  The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library.  If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section.  Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres apeal to different people.  This applies to the maturity of the reader as well.  Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age.  If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger peoples, or a different genre completely.  If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section.     The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differenciate towards such content.  On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked.  For one to complain about a book's contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the book's contents.  For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights @LOCATION1 has stood for

Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material.     The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading.     If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however.      Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them.     I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it.      I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see

Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves.      I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.     If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that @MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they @MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out.     Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear.     You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids @MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.     Libraries @MONTH1 always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this

People @CAPS1 Offensive by Libraries         I think that libraries are sometimes offensive,but not all the time. It  all depends on peoples different beilfs and thier culture. I can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive. I believe parents are more offended by things in the library ,because they don't want their kids to experience these things that are not the childs age. Movies that are at the library @MONTH1 be offensive ,because if a parent rents a moive for their child and gets home and puts in the @CAPS2. Then finds out that the moive they wasn't a kids moive ended up being an adults moive.           Parents who don't want their kids to look at inporatiate  things should not be suable for their childs age.One way to sovle this problem is to keep a eye on their child and make sure they don't go anywhere esle except the childrens area. This would sovle so many problems if parents would actually follow through with this it might work. Some parents bring their child up they way they want to. Also the parent or parents teach their kids that they don't need to go in any other area expect the one they are suppose to go in unless their parents tell them otherwise.       I do get offensive sometimes when I go in the library, because they are some people who thinks it's funny to look at things just for fun not for any purpose. They make a big deal about and I don't like when people do that ,because it makes you think of the library as not such a place you wanna be at. If i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library I would pass it up and not pay attention to it. But some people would tell the people who are running the library that this certain thing on their shlef is very offensive to me and bothering me.      If I had an issue with the library for some certian reason I would complain. Because complaining will more than likely do something about it. Instead,of not saying anything it won't get done or change it so it's not offensvie to others. I would let  them know how I felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner. When you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way, because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back.     I know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything. But one thing is for sure is to keep on living life and don't let simple things about a library product offending you or bother you.You could not got to the library anymore if it's a problem or ignore the image that is offending you. There are so many ways to handle a situation like this it's just how you handle it. One way is to be respectful to people and people @MONTH1 be respectful back. Your attitdue has a lot to do with telling someone that something is offending you. If you can't get anywhere that way then just forget it and move on

I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing. Theres no reason for all that. Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials.     First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it.      Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for. Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them.     For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do? Is it going to make the word a beteter place? I dont think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be. To educate and informate.     In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty. We would also be pretty missinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves

In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.     The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.     The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.     In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library.

Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them.           Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.      I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.      Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential.     The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get

Censorship in Libraries     In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful. There are also a lot of magazines, music, and movies. A lot of the movies are adult movies ,but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries. Most of the books, magazines, and movies are all reachable by little children. I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there.     When I went to the library as a kid, I went with my parents. We would go there and mainly go to the kids section. I can also remember going with my grandparents. I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something. I cannot remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive.     I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me. I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do. If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids. I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read.     I tend to not read very many books about the world. I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that. Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on, if they are.      If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them, than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves. Some adult @MONTH1 come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them. So in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves.
<START>

We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.     In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.     In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.      In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.     Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2. We need this fixed

Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life

Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.     Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people @MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers.       Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an @CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.     Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.      For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this; but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored. Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music.     As each day goes by the minds of children become more and more cerious as to what the world has to offer. The more parents keep there children away from things in life the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be. Every person is there own person; I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, ect. on the shelves of libraries; children will find out anyways, wither it is from friends, or the media.     Its not to say that your child will become corrupt if listing to such music, but I believe that at a certin age parents should have talks with their children about stuff that is happening in the world, because children are not going to go be children for long and you will not be able to control them forever.     Everybody was a child at one point in time and I am pretty such that most parents very much disliked when their parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or maybe that they wanted to see, but life aways is not fair and these are just on persons opinions.     Either way if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same things to all the books and movies, etc. there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things, it never fails. There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules; just think about it, if they disobay you once they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature.     So like I said before every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such, me personally I say just leave it and lets the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because yoy can not please everybody.

Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand. If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone.     Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people. In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear. Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm.      Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.      In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.      To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something.  Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity; just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person. These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truely vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the comunities are today.

I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know. I myself, 'would want to know, than not to ever have known.'

I belive that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from public libraries. What if a young child were to stumble across an innapropriate magazine.. They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions.     There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriatly or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts.     Personally, I think that most fictional books are intertainment only. They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way.      Most Libraries have areas sectioned of for adults only but they aren't monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue.     I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too?     The world is exposed to offensive material everyday. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no gaurentee that they won't take ideas from inaprpropriate viewings and use them. So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves.

Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone.

I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay. Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library.     It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start.     There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier. You learn so many good things from a libraries. The books and things in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree.

Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive.  There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson.     People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them.  For example, in life sombody @MONTH1 offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to dissapear after doing so.  How does this relate to libraries you might ask?  Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive.       It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch.  Just because you @MONTH1 have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out.  Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive.     You @MONTH1 be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.'  That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections.  If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out.  It is as simple as that.  Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time.       The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf.  She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ablitiy as well.  Therefore, a book that @MONTH1 not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it.  Eventually, there would be no books left.       In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out.  You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else @MONTH1 want to check them out

No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read.           I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or  if it wasnt a good book to have.     I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read.  I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. Theres something for everyone in a library.     This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'.
<START>

I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides no ones making you check out that book

hey what book is that lets me see it because I don't think I want you to read it because it is to graphic for a @NUM1 year old boy. This is what some parents might say to their child if they don't want them to read a certian kind of book or even a certin book. I feel that censorship is not needed in libraries, because either way the kids will be exposed to something the parents don't want them to see sooner or later      I do not belive that any one has thr rite to remove anything from the shelves except the library. The can go ahead and complain that they dont't want it there. But if the library has it the library should be able to keep it there wheathere or not people don't want it there. I think the only real people that can remove a book for the shelves is the managers or manager if they agree with the patron. Ohter than those certin people I don't think a reagular person can remove anything from the shelves.      At the library i go to they have any kind of book, music, movie, and magazine you want. Wether it is a adult content book to a rated r movie they have anything and they get new things every week. So if a person does not want a certin thing on the shelves they should not be able to by themselves take it from the shelves because what if another person wants to see the movie but they can't because a parent took it from the shelf because they did not want their kid being exposed to it. One time at my library i saw a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager the patron did not want the book in the section it was in because they felt it was to provacative for a childrens book. The manager refused to take it off the shelf becasue the library can have whatever books they want on their shelves.Another time i saw a person break a dvd because they thaught children at the age their children were should not be allowed to see those kinds of movies. But breaking the movie is just putting other people that want to see it put because noe htey can't because it is broken.     To summerize everything I do not think citizens should not be allowed to removeantything from the shelves only the managers of the library should be able to remove anyhting if they want

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2

I myself think that all books should be of the shelves because I do find some books to be offensive in their contents. I also find it very annoying when people have books and you are trying to talk to them @CAPS2 all they do is ignore you @CAPS2 keep reading i find that disrespectful. Myself though i do not like reading I find it to be boring @CAPS2 somtimes tireing unless it is actually a good book. I also could say that some movies should be taken off shelves because they are so stupid @CAPS2 have no point such as harry potter, twilight and most other books that have mythical creatures in them. Music on the other hand should @CAPS5 be taken off because it is alot easier to relate to and understand I @MONTH1 be wrong but thats my personal opinoin of the whole ordeal some music in the lyrics can show who you are and what you stand for in life music shows character @CAPS2 is easire to follow then movies or a boreing old book.I listen to music all the time you hardly ever see me with a book in my hands I sometimes do watch movies but they are more action , comady though I really don'@CAPS10 like scary movies though I do watch some @CAPS2 I don'@CAPS10 like ones with weird looking creatures in it thats just not what I look for in a movie. I can list some books, movies @CAPS2 music I like, for instant twoo books I like are  blood is thicker @CAPS2 untill we @CAPS4 again by @PERSON3. Movies I like are all five of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movies, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4 The @PERSON4 and my all time favorite @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 And the new karoti kid. Music I listen to consist of @CAPS8-@CAPS9, @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON2, @PERSON5, @LOCATION3, @CAPS10-@CAPS11, @CAPS12 @CAPS13, @ORGANIZATION5, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 they are all great singer song writers and do a great job at what they do @CAPS2 make millions off of it I mean come on people love music more then anything. there are movie music albums sold in the world the there are book and movies combind which I really think proves a big point when I say music is better. Serveys have been taken music wins everytime. So therefore this concludes my opinion on this subject and I hope I voiced it good enough to prove my point to people in the world that say books @CAPS2 movies are better because their not.

Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do.          Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds

@PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she @CAPS2 prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on.      To begin with, censorship @CAPS2 simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, @CAPS2 a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government @CAPS2 doing @CAPS2 wrong.      This topic now poses a question: '@CAPS2 all censorship bad?' Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it @CAPS2 books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship @CAPS2 applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only.      Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it @CAPS2 wrong. On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred @CAPS2 not bad either. In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance.

I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and say this and that shouldnt be aloud here. I also feel thats if you dont like the book dont look at it. Or read it. I mean I kind of understand about the magazines becouse somethimes there can be pretty bad. I mean at the same time its noones job to say what is right and what is wrong.                   The music I am @PERCENT1 with it being taken out of the libraries. some of the music people lisson to today is just not right or kids or adults. People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today. The movies at the libraries are pretty good they dont let thim get to bad i cant compain to much about that.        All around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it. Just some stuff that I would change but really what I think doesnt matter. Im only a @NUM1 year old kid i mean I can give my thoghts about it but thats about it. I love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going. If I dont like something thin i just dont read it or look at it and thats how everyone should be

'Should libraries censor reading material's to students at school.'That is a yes an no quistion because reading is good for people of all age's its just is the topic suitable for certain age group. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, But to an exstent they need to have books for kids at certain age groups. like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults. if the child wants t read more graphic material then they must have pramission from their parent. the reason i say that is there are things that get published by authord that are ment to be read by certain people.

Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another.

I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for.     Censorship in libraries is just uneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.      Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it @MONTH1 be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.     If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.     Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything.
<START>

I think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries.They are young eyes and they are to young to be looking at that stuff.They would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age.They would grow up the wrong way.We need to take a stand on what are kids look at.Fr the future we need censorship.please everyone take a stand
<START>

Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No  we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be.     I like @CAPS1 magazines. Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you?     I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. @CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem?     The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religous person, then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful.     Finally, i just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesnt mean someone else won't. You wouldnt want it to happen to you

First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. It always is a terror that falls violently.     Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself.     This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.     History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future?

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,          I think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive. People at libraries fight over a book. They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone.          People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 they get ther before me?'.          The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.          If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it. So, libraries need more than one copy.     In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There fighting for a book and you don't whant that. The libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. So, think before yo act. It can be found offensive at time.                                                                           Sincesly,                                                                         @PERSON1

What do you consider an offensive book? Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive. So how can you justify that a book, magizine, movie, music, etc. should be removed from a shelf due to content. Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive. The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc. and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others. So honestly no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc. do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed.      If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else. Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf. Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item.     So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf? No you can't. If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules

Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about. Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information. Just because a book @MONTH1 have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated by what the contets @MONTH1 have source of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelve for any whom that have an intrested.          As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable. Its really not that neccasary to be place in a library because its a place known for peace and quite and relaxation. If music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library. Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book.      Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it. Not all magazine have something that can be use to educate. Most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library.                      The library should be an experience of a learning envirnment and only materials that will be a good help instead entertainment for pleasure. Remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known. As to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book @MONTH1 be. As for music, movies, and magazines should be a limited for usuage in the library.

'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2'     @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats @CAPS1 I think. For ant book you can find some bad thing about it. People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work @CAPS4 that. Wether it is cusing, sex, gore, racsisem teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were foung in a book instead of real life.     Most young adult books have cusing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cusing every day. At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life.     Most adults think thats if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music. @CAPS1 adults don't understand is that teens doo @CAPS1 ever they want to be happy. The music of today's is very offensive, but the @CAPS4 it!!!!! THat is @CAPS1 is 'hot' in the music world right now.     Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't @CAPS4. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive???     Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it. Plus sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it.      Race is anouther big deal. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn. We need to learn about those kind of thing.      Keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want @CAPS1 ever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us. If we don't @CAPS4 it we will not read it or leason to it. Don't chose for us let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes....

Libraries, not many people like them, but most people do. Libraries are almost in every town. People like to go there to read book, get on the computers, and do activities with their families. But there are some things that people would really want to do things there but they cannot because of their age or so, or it just might be prohibited at all times. Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone?    Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are a irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it could be the same ammount of money on buying that item. If you are a responsible person then you are fine. But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out.    So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there, because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you cannot have that.     Libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books. A section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers. A section for the high schoolers and the adults and mostly everything will work out fine. Just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town.     Now that some facts and opinions have been stated hopefullly the libraries and librariens do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone. So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone

Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1'm writing your newspaper company this letter because @CAPS2 the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2,and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2.

This statment is not right. Peolpe should be alound to read what ever they went or linst to or watch what ever movie they went. When someone read somthing thats bad they @MONTH1 or not like it. So people should not take away books, movies,and music that are bad.      One thing that peolpe should have a choose of what they read and other stuff. Books some people like reading bad stuff beacuse they enjoy it. If the person do not like it they should put back and find somthing else to read. Now movies are a lot of fun to watch. But when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive sence or not. And the age thing yay you should watch a movie with andult if your to young. Now music is one thing that is offensive should not be takn off the shelves. Becasue if you dont like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people thats bad music when it could be some great music. Ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines. Its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines. if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house.      So people should not take off the shelves are books, movies, and music but they can take away magzines.People like the books and stoffe that have bad stofe in them. And there should be no taking off the shevels. Thats what i think of if somone toke somthing off the shelves.
<START>

I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries. People find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them. I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset.     In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days have a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them. The same with movies. Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested.     If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it. Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it. People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves.     People can make there own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read. Everybody can choose what they prefeir. Everybody has their own opion on things. I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without. Younger people find more interest in the things that seeem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal.      I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want. Lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things. If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries
<START>

If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies than don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be censored.     Censorship should be fo young childen. If your grown and get offended by something having the '@CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it. If a movie drops the '@CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it. i completly disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words.     I don't get offeneded by swearing because its usually used in a funny way, like telleing jokes, or it makes a crappy song good. Censoship is helpful, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will.          More often than not, kids learn cuss words fom paents or friends. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation. It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a childs environment.
<START>

The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to.  That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again.     If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive.  Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care.     I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them.  If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going.      So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid
<START>

I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok. Many people needs to read them and see what they are about. I think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve.          I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.     I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess thats just how it is now a days. You honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.     I do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc. should be removed from the shelves. It could be interesting to someone else but not you. Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material.

Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case

The library has many books, they would have anything that you could possibly imagine.The library is a great resource for any information. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day. Libraries carry many different kinds of books. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats. There are libraries all around us and are very convienent.     If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble, especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information, would show anything that would affend someone in any way, then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library they are exspecting clean reviews about the library.             If a library were ment to carry offensive products it would not be called the library. The library is ment to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out . Most libraries are pretty peticular of what they should or should not put out on there shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired.       In conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city. The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and etc. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one you should imediently tell the librarian or the libraries manager. The library @MONTH1 get in trouble and then again they @MONTH1 not

DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MOVIES, MAGAZINES, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFESIVE? I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.          FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THATS ONE REASON.     SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.     THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE.     SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR

Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds
<START>

I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, everybody has their own level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp.      People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves. Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item. It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it shoud be out for the choice to be up to that certain person. Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say  what age level should or should not be using that material.     A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days. But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to. People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person @MONTH1 find it offensive, does not mean that other people will.     If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple. Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them. Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic. This proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf.
<START>

I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.
<START>

The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?

Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @MONTH1 not see any true beauty. But when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truely offended.       When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyones' group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I new it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody.     @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.      @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to lingere for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me. I asked, '@CAPS2 happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay.     I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings

Dear Newspaper,     I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of redaing material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display.      It is best that they are in a solitare area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. If they watch a movie full of violence, they @MONTH1 feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best.     As a child is grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us, as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You @MONTH1 ask what it is i am speaking about. Well, i believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after affects of their actions.     Suggest that certain material @MONTH1 not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, in which sometimes revole around our every thought.      I do believe that certain media, should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time.                              Sincerely,                 @LOCATION1

Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.     People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader. Which @MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them. These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material.     People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them. The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else.     I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries. But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get. These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it. They do not have to read these books it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to. If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material. It is no one elses choice besides your own.

While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth, those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly. Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms etc. this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good, thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone.     One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and childeren to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. But if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands.     All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books

The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else.     The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to suppy books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want.      A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library. There were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased.      If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves.

Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain poeple? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want.     If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way.     When it comes to movies that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film i could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content.    Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it

I enjoy reading very much so and I have read several books since I've been in highschool. Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them.      Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive
<START>

I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some aweful material in it. The pictures in magazines, on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people @MONTH1 find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all aroung the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they @MONTH1 get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves.
<START>

Librarys have the right to diside how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material @MONTH1 be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials @MONTH1 be as offensive to one perwson, it @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many ohter rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves.      There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. Howver, some materials @MONTH1 be found offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 not be found offensive to others. A library @MONTH1 not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.      A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances. A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive. Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.     Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive. There simply would be nothin left. People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library

I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children? I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also

In today's world being a child isn'@CAPS1 the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly, weather it is the stress of school or what there doing this @DATE1. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not. I do not think that cencorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although that parents, and the government would disagree, cencorship is going to do nothing but make out future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn'@CAPS1 lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn'@CAPS1 be so nieve about the world either. So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered.       Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything children are still goint to listening to music that isn'@CAPS1 appropriate for their age, but they don'@CAPS1 know the meaning behind the lyrics. And cencoring movies and @CAPS1.V show aren'@CAPS1 going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access thing more easily. So unless we censore the internet to certian. Which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certian thing sooner or later.      Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesnt have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certian then cersorship wouldn'@CAPS1 be needed

Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writting to you @DATE1 because their is so much conflict on the issue of 'if materials in the library are offensive should they be removed from their shelves'. I know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them. Yes i said it they should stay wright where they are.     People all over this world get themselves worked up over all the little things in life but what we dont understand is their is always gonna be something in life we dont like and thats never going to change. Like this for example, people taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them to be removed. I mean come on people wake up and realize you are not always going to have things as you wont them theirs always going to be things you just have to deal with it.      I believe that these types of materials should stay wright where their at because people can over look them we just decied not to. We all make a big deal over something so small. People should just not look at it and move on dont sit their and fuss about it just turn around and walk away just because you dont like it dosent mean that others dont. Everybody in this world needs to see that their are things were not going to like but we have to get over them and move on. This will always happen and theirs nothing we can do about it.     All over the universe people @MONTH1 agree or disagree with what i have to say but its your perspective and what you think about it is your choice. I  will say though that they should stay but people need to get over themselves and see the truth in life and know that even though their are things we dont like dont sit their and argue about it just leave it and go your own way.     So this is my essay to you. People need to see their always not going to get what they want in life but they need to move on. Like this if you have a problem with the things around you such as taking offense to materials in the library and wonting them removed well sorry but no. learn to walk away from it because what you like @MONTH1 not be what others like and what they like @MONTH1 not be what you like we just have to go on with life leave it be because others oppinons @MONTH1 not match yours . Leave the materials alone because we as people need to see where not always going to get our way in life and to take hold of learning how to blow it off instead of making a big deal about something so little we could of walked away from

I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight. I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book. If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see.     All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commericials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display.I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult but who are we to say no you can not read that. The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place.          If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you. It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library.     Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online. If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored.
<START>

As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching.      Among many deabted materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated '@CAPS1' for all audiences, '@CAPS2' standing for parental guidence, '@NUM1' for parental guidence for ages @NUM2 and older, and lastly '@CAPS3' meaning that anyone under the age of @NUM3 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is '@NUM1' or '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone @NUM5 or older). Anyone who isn't @NUM3 or older @MONTH1 not enter a movie rated '@CAPS3' unless accompanied by someone @NUM7 or older. Depending on where you are, the restrictions @MONTH1 be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child.      As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, usually assuming they are the ones to but the album or the music for their child.       When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents.    Even though many restrictions put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously if you are @NUM2 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks @MONTH1 be decieving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashieers would stop a child and say, 'that's innappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents.     Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or puchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference

No books should be taken off the shelf. Most people have different taste in books, magazines or movies.  If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it? They can go find a different one. Not everyone should have the same taste as one person, thats what makes the person we are today. If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world.I'm more into horror novels more than anything. My own opinion, I think they have alot of excitement; with the killing and what not. I'm also not a big fan of reading, I read when I absolutely have nothing to do.Its very hard to move onto a different series of novels. Such as: romance, horror, adventures, even poetry!It takes alot to understand poetry. Poetry has alot of big descriptive words. @PERSON1 for instance, he's one of my favorite poets; he's actually pretty famous for what all he has done. Well, he didn't become famous until after his death.Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry. We're all different even when it comes to this.

How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read?  I mean I find them everyday for example, how people use there language like swearing or even the tv show they watch. I also hear when im with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do.     I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. Its a public places and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the librarey.  What would happen if a child got ahold of one and they were looking it and if gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rap, or miss happens with something wrong.     Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. so if a child see it they @MONTH1 think its alright to do it or they might think its amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basic like swearing. Lets say your child hears or reads horable language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you wont know where they heared or who told them.     The movies even have something to do with it to, because it all the movies are together kids to adults movies. they should separet the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug related, something that you dont want your children to or even hear to.     Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around.  They need to take those book that discribe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. Thats why i think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shevles and get them away from children
<START>

I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people.      One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like.      Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life.       In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will.

Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech.     I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing.     Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books.      Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book.     It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come?     Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom

In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music, books, magizines, and etc should be stayed on the shelves. If they can get illistrated they should be able to be read or listened to.      The things in this paragraph will be about the content of music,books, magizines, and etc. The music industry too many people think some songs are innapropriate but really that ruins the whole point of the whole entire song. Maybe it could be age adviced but thats all they should do they should not cut down the content. The magizines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are illistrated books. They should be aloud anywere if they got illistrated. Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theatres, @CAPS1, or on the @CAPS2.      From my experience I have seen people complain about these things. I really do not get why you should complain about these things. Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries
<START>

What is censorship? Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy. The real question is what are we limiting?   Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.      Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word. There is also some arguement to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an excepted word. Thats just how it was back then.     Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.      Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works

Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.     I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think? @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.     I believe censorship is unnessesary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.      Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?     Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.
<START>

If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere.      Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 offensive, others enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it.     Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There @MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through.      Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to.      Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'

Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary. I believe that many books in the school library are not apropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries becuase I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material. The material in this books are no differnt than what goes on in the high school years.      Most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and @MONTH1 be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone. At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs. These books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading. For example the books by @PERSON1, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregant, in jail, and homeless. I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them.       There should be a limit on the censorship. Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, what is the difference? That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can conect with teenagers. Many books are an authors experience, so they are meant for high school age. Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Librabries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries.      Someone @MONTH1 become offened by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf becuase of one person. If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book @MONTH1 be someone else's way from escaping the hardships in their life.     Many adults would disagree with my statements becuase they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, do drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things. I feel like this is not true becuase the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that. What is the differnce between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television? I see many worse things on the @LOCATION1 than I read in books. Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends.     These are just my oppinons, some people @MONTH1 agree with me and others @MONTH1 disagree, but I am going to stick with my oppinons

Censorship in Libraries.                                                                           Censorship is a big conflict in many libraries. @CAPS2 are plenty of offensive books that shouldn't be put on the shelves.  Many schools call these books, magazines, and movies, '@CAPS1.'  @CAPS2 is often a week where people read all of the books that have been @CAPS1 from school libraries.  I participate in this school wide challenge beacause I disagree with banning books.  Banning books can be good and also very hurtful in many reasons.     First off, I like to think of banning books or anything else from the author or writers view.  How would you feel if you spent around @NUM1 years writing this story/movie for kids that got @CAPS1 in the first couple of weeks it was on the shelves.  I don't think that many people would enjoy that.  I also think that many people don't think of authors at that big of a deal.  When I think of that it makes me think of all the things we couldn't read in our world. Including, newspapers, books, and magizines.  Maybe even include the fact that it takes a lot of work to write the things on what people want to hear, or see.  I feel like when books or movies get @CAPS1 or removed, it makes the author feel like they're worth nothing.  The parents point of view makes things a lot worse.      Think of it this way, your child comes home from school with this book that he/she wants you to read with him.  You sit down and start reading, when suddenly you come across a violent or inappropriate secne in the story.  You stop reading all of a sudden and look at your child who is enjoying this violence and loving this story!  What do you do?             Many parents would call the school and explain what happened and complain about banning this book and taking it away from children that could get this book.  Taking it away has no point because just banning it from the school library doesn't mean that they can't find it elsewhere.  How do you think your child would feel having loved this story now it's gone?  I know that it would make me feel like I did something wrong.  Taking things off shelves also has a good side to it.      When you take the book, movie or magizine off the shelf it is gone forever from that library.  This can be a good thing because then kids won't have the obvious reason to get the story.  If you don't want your child or other children to see it then it is quite a good idea.  It makes the @CAPS1 object harder to find and also harder for the kids to grab intrest to.  If the book or movie isn't around then they won't want to read the next one or see the next movie. @CAPS2 are many different views on censorship, which could effect how people choose what happens in libraries.     My view on this topic was negitive and I support that fully.  If the author works hard on writing the story they shouldn't get punished for expressing their feelings in a story. Many different poeple come across this issue and @CAPS2 are many different views on the topic.  Next @CAPS1 book week I'll be supporting the authors that got crushed by their work getting @CAPS1.  I hope that you will too.
<START>

Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different veiw points. For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? Two, @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways. Also @CAPS2, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read.      With all of us being different all over the world. Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books. All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely?  To me, in my eyes is just not right. It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out. What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away? Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do. People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot.     Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this? We are all the same, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books, I know many book readers with different types of tastes. No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different. To many people other than myself, would agree with that. So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries
<START>

Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past. in history we dont block any offensive events that take place so why should we removed any books that have offensive material in them. it would be wrong to strip the kids of any learning tools.          books are a very important learning tool in todays schools and there is somthing new in every book that a kid can learn from. so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing. and doing this on purpose would  be aginst everything that schools stand for.          there are many diffrent janras of books, but not everybody loves every jonra if a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to there culture, wich most likely will have  offensive language and events play out. if you were to take this away from a youngadult in school; once more this person would be missing out on books because nows they are not intersted at any of the books in the libary.       if you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opertunity you shouldnt do it. but the fact is there any many reasons why you shouldnt remove any literture from libary shelves
<START>

libraries shouldn't remove items just becouse some people find it ofensive. People prefer difrent types of books so renoving some reduses the selection. A lower selection of books means less people have a reason to go there.

Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own oppinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human minds. All over the world young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing. Everyone reads different kind of books, whether its mystery, romance, or bible based books, people read. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library.      When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offensive by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do.     Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, But that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds. They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual.     Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there is so many different genres. The music industry try their best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone. Music is used for many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To band music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever. There would be no music to listen to.     People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers, but not be acceptful for young kids. That's why they should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inapropriate. There would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy it.     No, books, magazines, movies, and music can not be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kind of subjects, and stories for everyone. Each materials brings enjoyment to different people. To band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty. What kind of library is that
<START>

I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.  Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere

Dear newspaper,     In my opinion I don't think that censorship in libraries should be on materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines and more materials. Censoring materials in the library could resolve in many problems. I don't agree with the censorship in libraries on materials for many reasons. In my upcoming paragraphs, I will explain why I diagree with libraries having censorship on a lot of their materials.     Many libraries in the world @MONTH1 have censoring on their materials. I believe that libraries have alot of censoring on most of their materials due to the fact that they @MONTH1 have children under the age of eighteen constantly viewing a lot of explicent content. Libraries shouldn't censor their materials but in my opinion they also shouldn't let under age children check out any kind of material that is only ment to be viewed by adults. Also if computer access is offered to children, an adult superior visor should be near by to make sure that no explicent content is being viewed.     Censoring in libraries could resolve in many problems, such as, customers not getting all the information they need for a centain material, children not reading up to their abilities or standards, and also children not learning enough or getting information that they need for school. If all of these things happen prior to the fact that libraries have censors on their materials then many libraries will not get as any customers. Yes, most people @MONTH1 visit libraries for the wrong reasons but to other people, those wrong reasons @MONTH1 be the reason for them to gain more information.     Materials in a library could also be found offensive to most people. But what's found offensive to most people could be found useful to other people. If something is found offensive to one person I don't think it should be removed from the shelves. If books and or materials are removed from the shelves, that can hide so much useful information that people could gain.      In conclusion, I don't think censorship should be put on materials in libraries due to the fact that many information could be lost. Censorship doesn't always mean that the material is bad, it can also mean that the material is just not appropreite to be viewed or read by that certain age group. If a library that I visit has censoring on most of their materials, I would convince the library staff to take the censoring off. Censoring is not always bad and it's not always good either but it can hide alot of information from us which is not good at all.

I think that all books, music,movies,magazines, and anything thats offensive should be took off shelves because @CAPS1 are lil kids that read books and they dont need to hear or reed offensive things. But at the same time for the peope that do wanna hear or reed things like that then their should be a area in the librarie for materials like that.                    @CAPS1 are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books,movies,magazines other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves because it could be racist or just offening certin things and people don't wanna see or reed about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldnt be alounded because it can hurt someones feelings.                  I have my own observations with reading some books from my school librarie and have came acrossed some words that was offensive. like in some books they use the word nigger and since im black it's offensive to me i know that they are not saying it to me but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. Im not sayin that it is offensive towards all people but it is me so the way they could is like i said instead of having offensive books out on shelves they should have one area where materials like that could be found in stead of having the material where childeren  and other people will get offened.           The last thing i wanna talk about is that for childeren and other people they dont wanna see nasty things that are in books if i had a kid i wouldnt want my childeren too c nasty things that could be offensive to. @CAPS1 books also that talk about drugs and people dont wanna hear or read about that it. but @CAPS1 are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that like older people they have diffent point of views about things so thats why again @CAPS1 should be one area in libraries for materials like that.     In conclustion i think that @CAPS1 should hear me out and take in what i have to say because the material thats are in books,music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody any race could be offened by what they see or read so again @CAPS1 should be a place in libraries for that

Censorship is a big part of a lot of things at the library. There are books, movies, magazines, and computers that anyone that want to get on can do so. Kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends. Strict parents might believe that books, magazines, and music are offensive and should not be at the library, But that isn't what everyone else thinks.       I believe people have different views about things. There are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it. Others think there kids seeing those offensive things will make them learn from it. Another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking. Not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone. Most people do not go to libraries because of that.      Libraries are fun to go to. You can just about get any book there you want to read. There is no point for any parent to be worried about there child reading a book that isnt for there age group, because libraries are very good at having the sections labled for age groups. They also would not be able to check out the book because the staff there are good at making sure it isnt a book that shouldnt be read by that person. Also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult. So the parent can keep an eye on there kid if she doesnt believe its right for them to read the offensive books. Parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad.      Talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book your reading or just hangout. The staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something. I think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk.      In libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there. Books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones. So if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section.

A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people. Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive?     If books, music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves. They should have a section for those certain kind of materials. To accsess  that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone. Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So therefore thats why they would have to be removed.     I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons. Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun. Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs.

Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age?  No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.  So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.

Many books in libraries have profanity, it just depends on how you read and anazlyze the profanity. To some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head. To others the words are just offensive. I disagree that most books are offensive to readers I believe that they just help the writers get their points across.      Many children come across books with offensive language, but if they only read books that are within their age level then they shouldn't have these problems. In adult books there is more offensive language, but to adults eyes and ears its a different story because they hear, and possibly say a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow.     I believe that any offensive reading material should be found and then sent to a certain area of the library where if you are an adult then you can check these books out. This is a way to keep the children away from these books, words, and to keep them 'innocent' still. Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow, but of course this is up to their guardian.     It's not necassarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending, which is most likely to help the theme. Children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves. They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only

All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.  The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, mvies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material.     Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs.  If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book.  If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur.     If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s).  If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf.  Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again?     I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material.  The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.

In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out
<START>

I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again.     I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future.     Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever.     In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again

I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @TIME1 world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up.     Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country. People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries.     My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book.     These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @TIME1 world because there are many things in @TIME1 world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone

I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in
<START>

Everything is offensive to someone. There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. here is a good senario; there is a childrens book. It is one of the gratest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. @CAPS1 good bye to that book. Some people would probably think '@CAPS1 its only a childrens book. I'm sure we will survive.' @CAPS1 lets move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the bible is offensive. @CAPS1 thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. Thats a couple more books. Now we have violence.      Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obsence images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable.      The @LOCATION1 government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying; 'you can not say this.' That moves on to; 'you can not say.' then; 'you have no say.'     In developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens. They shoot you. A better word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to. Do you see much difference?     Supervisation is a powerful thing. Guess what it can do better then censorship. With a supervison, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. The have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right.      Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and oppertunities for children. It causes violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. Although censorship has the ability to do more damage then any single person, it is not 'bad'. Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. But good intentions do not keep wrong consequenses at bay.

With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper.

Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind.     I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.      If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way
<START>

The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do.
<START>

I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I think its wrong to do so, because any book should be read know matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone.      Now ive not really seen anything that i'd fine offensive, but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see. But nothing that i found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it.
<START>

In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud.      When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done.     One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time.     With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it.     This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want.      On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life.               To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you,  but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left.
<START>

I think books that have nudity, curse words, or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good. They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older. They just arent appropriate. No childeren should know about drugs, sex, or epspecially gang violence. Its stuff they should never even find out about. So i think we should take them books off the shelf, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy.
<START>

NO, I think books and ect. should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin. As long as it's  apporiate for the enviroment and its surronds ,there should'nt be any  problems.                                                                                                   If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left. Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views. It's most likely that someones goin to get offened. In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened. Some offensive things are part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now. What's a child without it's @CAPS1?             Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ,but their not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery.Books about how only a couple of us made it. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other. Papper telling how are black communties are failing.                So in my opioin, no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on. It's apart of @CAPS1 and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself. People always saying kids should read more. What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive?
<START>

I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps.     First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it. Finding a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies.     Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers.     Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated @CAPS1 movies, or rated @CAPS2 video games. Books and music can be organized in this fassion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around.     In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart. One, its not fair for people who are not offended. Two, buisnesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem

Dear, Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play.      What I believe to be crude, @MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased. I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.      The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.     I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence.                          Thank you for your time,                         @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @PERSON1

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs.

In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.     In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them

Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive  should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries?    In my opion, I think that the boss or manager of the stores should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids.      Today I will inform you @NUM1 reasons why boss or managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids.     One reason, why the boss and managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that some times kids go the stores and when the parents are about to pay what they are going to buy kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probaly the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they  should not be looking at and the parents do not but attention to what their kids are looking.     Another reason, why the boss and managers should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and labraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote someting about thier culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition.My last reason why boss or managers should removed the books, magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when I go to labraries and I see this little kids waching at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate I get questinable and in my mind I said 'why the boss or mangers don't removed the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or  inappropriate and that might be something  bad to show them. If the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study  in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines.In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries  because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids. I all ready explind my reason why the boss and manager should removed the books or magazines from the shelves stores and libraries

I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place.Also,I dont think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in there lifetime.Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes.Try to see where they come from and there life style.Im not as big reader or anything but wants I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book.So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading.I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me.I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books.I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better.

There should not be any style of censorship in the @LOCATION1. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves.      In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against @CAPS1 policy. One of the things that sparked our countries secession from @LOCATION2, was censorship. The @CAPS2 would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution.      I do, however, agree with some censorship. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed. with out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated.     I think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries. Instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them. I feel strongly that I have a right as an @CAPS1 to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see. If we start restricting what we as @CAPS5 are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom; we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especialy 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy.     Censorship in the @LOCATION1 is a direct violation of our consitiution. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it. By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as @CAPS5. We also allow our right to be informed to be excercised.

Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material.     Everyone is intitled to there own opions. Theycan do and say what they want. Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie.     If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?

Censorship is a contraversal topic. Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitles to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that.     Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section.     Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view be just one of many. Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offened is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it.

I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay.

I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it. That is what i have too say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit

I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.     The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse.      The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.        The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.     That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it

How can writing be offensive? Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently.     What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults. The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them.      If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be @LOCATION1 today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement.

In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people wether it is politics or religion. The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive.     When @LOCATION1 was finally free from @CAPS1 a main goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge achievement for the @ORGANIZATION1. Allowing people to remove matieral from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government.     Another law that @CAPS2's appriecate is, freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what @LOCATION1 is practically based on. With out this wouldn't we be back into the old ways that @CAPS3 fought to change? This is a question you must think about when making this important decision.     Finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is easy to find someone that is offened by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decideds to find the @CAPS4 offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelve and tell the @CAPS5 sorry? If we decided to allow this would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines for us?      It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelve because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as @CAPS3; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to effect our later generations.

From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves.      '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so.      Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it?      From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things.      From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever

I belive that thier should @CAPS3 be sesorship because we live in @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 belive in freedom and I do to, sensorship is @CAPS3 the way.my thoughts about people that find  a book offensive slould @CAPS3 read the book if thay heard it was a bad book or thay dident like the way the cover looks thats thier problem dont ruin it for everyone els that likes the book.say if two people found a book offensive an five people liked the book dose that mean that it should be removed.What if you where one of thos five people and your favorite book was gone and you asked why and the librariean said 'well two people flaged the book for being offensive so it was removed '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 a book person but one time in school we read a book as a class called farenhite @NUM1 I thought it was a good book for its time,  I head that some people wanted to ban the book and some people did.Two words for thos people @CAPS3 cool.I think if you walk into a librarie you sould expect to see alot of different ideas because thats freedom and the woulds @CAPS3 pefect.So what @CAPS2 saying is thay should come up with a new system for librareis if a majority of people flag book offensive and thay dont want their kids seeing it then thay sould seperate thos books,movies,magazines,ets., from erery thing els @CAPS3 remove them.A message to thos people -If you are one of thos people that finds a picifice book ofensive you should know where thay are and stay out of that side of the librareie.thats my thoughts and views on sesorship in libraries.

Many of us have been at the library once in our life time, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with? Well many of us have. Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little borther/sisters, or friends?    The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a nacket picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids. Well we can do something about that. Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship. The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves. A lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive. They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influins.  In the library there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies. The people that work at the library should remove all the bad itams. Allowing to have all the nacket pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it. This is why the libraries should remove all this books, movies, magazines, and even music! Many of the older people @MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them. Well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff. Some of the older people @MONTH1 think different and others they @MONTH1 think the same.   Many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books. That's why removing these itams are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learing how to have a boy/girlfriend

Libraries are public for a reason, and that is to interest people with different types of entertainment. I know some people have their opinions about things but that is why there are variaties because every single person is different. In my opinion no I do not think certian materials should be banned becuase they @MONTH1 have a more mature content than others think is appropiate. Disagree with me that is alright but, have you ever stopped to think about issues like this? Im going to list a few reasons with explainations on my opinion becuase I think they @MONTH1 point out a few good concepts on why I do not believe they should be banned.     First, in the present society everybody has different views and opinions on things that should be discussed. The public has a right to entertain themself any way they would like to choose and with any material or subject matter they would like. Taking away their entertainment would be the same as telling them that they cannot wear the clothes they would like, or drive the car they want. If you were to walk into a library and see a subject that does not fit your standards or interest than you should simply walk away and find a more suitable subject matter for yourself. Some people look at things in a totally different way than you, @CAPS1 because you do not like different styles of entertainment does not mean somebody else dosen't.       Second, You would be takng jobs away from many people who love what they do. People have an issue with some content of books, or movies, but that is sometimes based on what an author is feeling, or even what their life maybe like. Others they write about real life events things that happen to normal people everyday, that should be looked up upon to have people write their stories down for the whole world to see. Criticizing subjects of entertainment is downgrading different forms of art. Pretty much what people feel like is, its not ok to have a mature subject discussed about in a book but in a painting it is, very hipocritical.     Lastly, If the material being pulished today was wanted off the shelfs of a library, than why would it even be printed and sold to people all over the world? It is because there are people who do like it and do not have a problem at all and like me is not bothered by it what so ever.      In my opinion i do not think any form of entertianment should be banned or taken away from society in anyway, because than you would be taking peoples joy

In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent.     Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well.     I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand.      Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music.     There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone.     I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time.    In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it

The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon.      I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.      Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.      There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.      But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '

My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not  be what others believe. With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier. Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best.     With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'? There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved.     My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right. Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up. The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions

Books are gateways to other worlds.  Today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of.  People use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves.  Now the content of some books are not always appropriate.  Schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves.  Students then can't read a book simply because someone else didn't appprove of the content.  That is unfair and should be stopped.  Students should have the right to make choose what they want to read, yet some people want to take that right away from students.  Students, are also able to make choices on what's appropriate for them to read.  If lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted.     The content of what goes into a book is up to the author.  The books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader.  Sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them.  Now some people think that because a book is inappropriate in their views then it shouldn't be avalivable to read at all.  This is unfair not only to any potiental reader of that book, but also the author who worked hard to write that book.  Students are smarter than many people give them credit for.  They know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but if the choice of what they read is left up to other people they feel betrayed and untrusted.      Students have as many rights as people who don't go to school.  If books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate.  Now the students freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains is books choosen worthy by other people.  Rights are something guarenteed to students as the enter school, buty now rights are slowly being taken away from students.  The right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken.  As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  If one person says they think a book should be taken away, then another person wants another book taken away, until the point where no books are left then how will students ever get to read?     Books are essential to a students growth into adulthood.  If people gain the right to take books off shelves then music, movies, magazines will all get taken off shelves too.  Books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world.  Students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read.  Books should remain where they belong, in schools on the shelves.

Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in librarys? Well here's my perspective.      I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others.      How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. So that's my perspective on it
<START>

There are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library.      Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.      So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @LOCATION1. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them

Some books are offensive to some people. But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. How do they cokme up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. Thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want

Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican.     Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be.     The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.     I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it

If materials are offensive they should not be displayed. Offensive materials can have big effects on children younger than at least ten years of age. I believe that if materials at a library are found offensive and proved to be offensive, then they should be removed.     Materials at libraries are not for everyone. A lot of it is especially not for young children. For example: @CAPS1 could be a young child wanting to check-out a movie that looks interesting  to him/her. The movie could be rated @NUM1 but the parents still check it out for them. Once they watch the movie, it @MONTH1 have some heavy language, sex-related humor or content. Then the child is learning and seeing all of this hapening in a motion picture. Also if they have nervous parents, the library could get some calls. Today, a lot of younger children about @NUM2+ have seen, watched, or read something that had profanity in it or inapropriate conduct in it.     People have read some of the material that the library has and spotted some profanity not knowing it was in @CAPS1. If a religious man/woman checked out a book or a magazine from the library and spotted the profanity they put in a lot of these books and magazines, it would absolutely bother them. If they won't take them off of the shelves, the least they can do is keep a list of all of the materials that have heavy profanity, sex, and strong violence in them. They should do that so they can warn the person who is checking out the material.     With all of the nasty things that are seen in books, movies, magazines, etc., people need to be alerted to what they read and watch. Some of the books can get pretty nasty and terrible with all of the things they say. Library materials must be checked. If they are found offensive, and proved offensive, they should be moved.
<START>

People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries.      One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they belive in. Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender,country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences are also have a place. Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong.     All this things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too.

Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. @DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.      When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.      Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.     What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.     As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1

Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom.
<START>

People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for.

Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive? If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things. I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world.      There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children. We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life.     These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children. If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs. I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away. You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it.

There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.      People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies

Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @MONTH1 be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.      Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them.  If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.      In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.      Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.      If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults @MONTH1 find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it

There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.     Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it.     Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.     The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.     The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are

Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed.     Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library

One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully

This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries.     I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive.     If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued.     Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people.     In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have

Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed? No,  I strongly disagree.           Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out. In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys.     Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex. Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case. Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self. People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others.      In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion. You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem. For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.

No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive.  I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely.  That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it.  There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction.  It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.      I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it.  I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins.  I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand.  To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.  If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from.  They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on.       Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge.  We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education.  But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from.

Censorship in libraries is an inportant thing in schools and in the public. It is inportant beause some of movies, books, and magizines have a bigger influince on the kids then most people think. Like some of the really gory movies the are always people in the movie gettin cut up or shoot. Do you really think that some kids dont think about hat stuff. Somtimes the kids can get it in there head that they can do what they see or read.     Like in the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored. And some kids @MONTH1 think that that is ok. And they can go down to there librarie and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now if you r using it as a thing to teach kid that it was the way things use to be and that it is wrong then that is ok. You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the wright thing.     And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public librarie are just not the kind of thing that kids should not be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines the just show that it is ok to carie a gun were ever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids @MONTH1 be confused that you need a lisense to do all of that. You have to at least put and age limmiet of some stuff.     Go's the sameway with some of the books they always start out good and then the just turn into a big mess of gor and vileance. Like the spere it started out with a group of people going under water to explore a ship. And they find a big shpere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagin it and it comes true. Well when a kid reads that they @MONTH1 think that they can do that and they start imaging that they can eather hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it wont work they @MONTH1 do it to them themselves.     So it just come to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries and if you can take them out then at least put and age limite on them

Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library.     When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.        My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.

Censorship in Libraries               Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 are many books, magazines, and movies out @CAPS1 that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children @MONTH1 be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.      All people of @LOCATION2 have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries @MONTH1 be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.     Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. @CAPS1 is content out @CAPS1 that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults @MONTH1 find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. @CAPS1 are many different types of books and music out @CAPS1 and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.      In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what @CAPS1 child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. Afterall, you cannot shelter children from everything.      Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the @LOCATION1, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as indivuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books life on the shelf for any of us.

Censorship               Censorship is it needed in todays societey? Where things that were considerd bad @NUM1 even @NUM2 years ago are ok today to be veiwed read listened to and so on. Is it a  needed process or should libraries have free will to stock there shelves with what ever they seem fit to be there.Is it still a good process to use or is it a outdated uneeded resource that is now no longer needed.          Everybody in todays soicitey says to read, but libraries @MONTH1 not have the type of litature that your are in to, so why would you want to read somthing that you do not like because the library dos not have the book that you wanted to to see i.       I believe that censorshop in libraries should be their  to remove any book the find offenseive or immoral from there libary. I do not belive they should remove books becasue of  bad language, or somthing about god.        I think that books or magazines or movies with '@CAPS1' content should be removed from libraries if they see it fit. Libraries should only feature books tht they want to have not ones that are popular but considerd 'bad' by the library. They should only have books they want to have.       I do believe that their should be censorship in libarys. I just do not belive that it should be a harsh system. I think that they should set standards on what they want to have and following those standards on books they buy.               I do think however that some libraries will set their standards to low or high that they wille ether have many books that are considerd 'bad', or no books at all. It is a very fine line when it comes to materials that the library has to be considerd good or bad. I think libraies should havea  set of standards nation wide to set what type of material is good for libraries.          I believe that censorship is still a needed, and helpful process. I just think that it is to much of a opionated process. not enough facts or opions of the poeple. I think that is should remain in use for society i just belived it should be more under control then it is today.

Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves

Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter.

Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libaries shelfs?  We all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of.  In this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it.  It is nearly immposible to do that.  Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf.     Have you seen the banned book list lately?  I have and some of those books on there are ridciolus.  Here are a few @PERSON2, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4.  I could go on and on, the list is a mile long.  Some of these books have historical meanings behind them.  There is also morals behind them. I think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them.  It's not liuke we have never heard them words.     In @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4 they have banned it from schyools because of the use of the word 'nigger'.  This is not a nice word in our day and time. Back when we had slaves that is what they were called.  It is points and views from an anti-slavery author.  In @CAPS7 @CAPS8 it is banned because of animals talking.  Come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time.  I belive that if kids don't no that animals cant really talk we might have problems.     Do you find the show @PERSON3 the @CAPS9 offensive?  Well it has been banned because @CAPS10 is racit against @CAPS11.  I would like to no how some of these people come up with this at.  Whoever picks up this offensive matrial has a choice wheater or not they read it.  It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive.  I belive that it is totally up to you, if you read it.  Just like if you go to a mvie store they have the movies rated.  You dont want to watch rated @CAPS12 movies then dont rent it.  They could use the same method with books.     Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelfs?  If you say yes, I would like to no why.  It is your choice to read it. There are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more.  Just because books have vulgar lanuage, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelfs.

I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do!     There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated @CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like @NUM1 to rated @CAPS1. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated @CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater.     Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The @CAPS4 of @PERSON1', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of @CAPS4.     I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them.     The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch. When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want.

In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.
<START>

There are some movies,books,music,etc that @MONTH1 be found  offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the          appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive,then      you shouldn't have read the book.Books,music,and movies are made to entertain you,however,if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you!  I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it.  In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend.

I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many.But I think that I have a pretty good outlook , and a pretty good view on this. In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain , and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing , and should maybe be inforced heavier.           Censorship. Should books, music, movies , magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf.. I believe that it is @LOCATION1 , and everyone should have their right to read what they want to,  and what they don't . I believe , that if someone want's to read something vulgur , then let them. If they are an adult , it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it , that no , children should not be aloud to read things that @MONTH1 be vulgar, sexual , etc.           In keeping children away from these vulgar things , they should have,or keep seperate sections for kids, and adults. I dont think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay , and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it,  that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to.           I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this , they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture ,and message ,of them thinking it's okay  . No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc. ,and yes some @MONTH1 argue that kids dont copy what's on t.v. at all . But I think that t.v. , books, and music affect alot of how children view the world.           As much as I love rap music , and movies such as A.T.L ,rappers such as @ORGANIZATION1, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music , books, what we watch on t.v. , and what we read in the magazines , have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood , or sad or depressed.           The media ,music , t.v., books , magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing , I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood , your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done. Children are still machuring ,and are like a sponge. Censorship , is a very sensitive , and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, whats yours ?

To whom it @MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.

To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide.

Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.

Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!
<START>

Would you ever read a book about the @CAPS1 times if your @CAPS2? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If your a colored man/woman, are you going to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. How about if you are a mother, are you going to want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Are you going to let your child read that book? Of course not! So you are probably wondering why they are even on the shelves, right? Its on the shelves for basically one reason, to drownd us in the knowledge it holds.     Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there is always going to be one person who is against it all. When we read, we find books that are to our own enjoyment, we look for books that can spark ideas and images in our heads. Most of us however, don't quite understand why others refuse to read such a book or even hold in their hands a book that is different from all their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people no matter their age, gender, sexuality, or their race. Its just a way of life.     Some stories are there for our entertainment, some catch our emotions, and some our there for our knowledge. When authors write, they usually think of events that have happend or what they predict could happen in the future. Authors try to get you to understand the world around you, not by trying to offend you in anyway. Books tend to affect people in many ways, possitive and yes, sometimes negative. Its something they can't really control though, so you can't really blame anyone for you being offended.     I don't agree that libraries shouldn't have these books on their shelves, I think they are good for us. No, i don't mean we should go around eating books. We should take time to read some of those so called offensive books. You are probably thinking, there is no way I'm going to pick up that type of book and sit down and read it. However, let me tell you that if we read these books, the more people will understand about how terrible times were back then and how some things are still bad. Take abortion into perspective. Books about abortion give us an idea about how horrible it is or how it can not only effect the women who go through with it. It appeals to the emotions of others in a way that makes them think twice about lifes decisions.     Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being. When it comes down to the choice, you will know just what to do. You know how useful books are in helping us see the differece between right and wrong. You understand why books are placed on shelves for in the first place, no its not for the money. I know that you are going to understand what I'm trying to tell you. Now head on over to your library and pick up a book about something you would like to no more about. Who knows, maybe you will get a book that makes you think twice about what information is held in between the bindings
<START>

In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another.
<START>

Take it @CAPS1?          How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we can not stop them, their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere. It is all over the internet and you can't control that.     If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously. They shouldn't have inappropiate things in public stores or places children can go. That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids. Some people should just know better and take it @CAPS1.     Almost every day that i go online, i see something on the side of the website advertising some kinda of pornograghy site. Its unbelievible how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see. If they're going to continue to do this, @CAPS2 needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites. I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages.     I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others. Selling movies, magazines, and music saying or doing things that are rebelious is easy money for opper teens and older people. They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things, everyone loves to watch, read, or listening to something funny.     So basicly we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that. the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day. It should die down eventually. We can only hope for the best

Libraries have always had interesting materials, such as, books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials.          I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting? Thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books. If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books. If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out.     Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them, its your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still dont need to be told what to do. Its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go.     If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself. I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book. Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are. Thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life.
<START>

They should not be removed from the shelves. If someone finds it offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. If someone finds it offensive then they can ask for that material to be put on the highest shelf their. They have a choice on whether they can get it or not. Many materials found in a library even if it is offensive can be helpful for someone else. The material could have or show some much needed information.      The people who find it offensive have the right to not look at it. Just cause there is some kind of material they find offensive does not mean that everyone does to. The people do not need to look at something that they find offensive. If there is something offensive about just ask a librarian if they can place that book or movie up higher on the shelves.      If they find something offensive about the material then they can just not look at. Just don't check it out if you find it offensive. If they need it out of site you can always put it on the highest shelf.      There are a lot of offensive material in libraries. Even though they are found offensive to someone, someone else could use that material for a paper or project. Getting rid of a material can lose someone information about whatever they are researching. The books are always the easiest way to get information but not when you are getting rid of them.      The reason why material from libraries should not be taken away is cause the kids can still find that stuff on the internet. If you get rid of those materials you should probably get rid of your internet too. No matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it. So the offensive material should not be taken off shelves in the library because they are needed and children will find out about the offensive stuff when ever they want to
<START>

If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library,  movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop.     All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposees. These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people, they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridicolous.      So, say you stumbled across a book about the @ORGANIZATION1 in the library and you are a person from negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain to me. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself?     When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called '@CAPS1'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her childrens lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.'      Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed. You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies, you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as. That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great.
<START>

No, because people likes different books, movies, music, and magazines. If people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries. They will go some where else to get the movie or what ever there getting. Some peoplpe want them to remove it but some don't want them to be removed.           If you don't want your kid's to read them , leison to them, or whatch them don't let them get them

What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest.     Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials.     Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure.     Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library.     I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment.     In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions.

Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it
<START>

Well today i am going to talk to you about censorship in books, Music, Movies, an Magazines  in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty grafic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, @ORGANIZATION1. Sports, @CAPS1,  just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally.  So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know.     Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call.     But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, @ORGANIZATION2, an @CAPS2. are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff.     Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a @CAPS3. or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything. But all i am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there an their is alot of good things to. but that doesnt give you the right to remove them

Do I think offensive reading materials should be taken off the shelves in libraries? No, books should not be taken out of libraries. If students go to school and they are in high school they pretty much already know what is going on around the world. Teens do talk about their lives so pretty much @CAPS1. High and @CAPS2 students are going to hear. If the parents are sending their child to school and they don't want them to hear about it then don't send them to school! In school they will hear verbal arguments and see fights. If the parents don't want them to hear about it from other kids than they tell them, they explain it to them. One way or another they will find out. It can come from the parents, their friends, teachers anybody. Teens do not care if your child is watching when they are fighting; they are not worried about that at that time.     The saying 'one person ruins it all for everybody,' well thats because some teens need to grow up and act their age. If you can't act your age than you shouldn't be in the grade you are in. Kids and teens need to grow up if they can't read a book without being inmature about it than don't read it. If their parents let them watch movies that they think they are old enough to watch than don't take advantage of that.          Taking books out of the libraries will not change anything. Kids will still fight and rough house. Yeah some books are a little outragous, but not all books. To be honest libraries should have sections of books depending on the age or grade they are in. High schoolers should be able to control reading about sex, drugs, or drinking. If they are not responsible to read that than they shouldn't get that book anyway. Songs made today can get a little out of hand. If your child listens to that kind of music with all the bad words, talking about sex, drugs, alchol. Than parents all you got to do is take those songs away. Teens that are mature shouldn't get punished just because inmature can't watch a movie, listen to sond, read a book or a magazine. It's not fair to those people. People that act their age should be able to read, watch the movie, or anything just because they can handle the situation better. So don't punish everybody just because of some inmature kids that ruin it for everybody

Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries.     I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material. Then maybe the library should consider removing the item. Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about situation.     In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts

'hey', I believe that certain materials, such as book, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.        First, I know that people have different views appon things such as magazines, books, and music. And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other perople. Such as music there are all kinds of music out there. And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt. Because A lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it.      Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem. Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive. So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right.           Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it. But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place. And yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us.        So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer. Because So many people have different opinions, and beliefs appon things.

According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library. Should we beable to have the right to take a book, magazine, movie etc. off the shelf freely? Whether if we're offend by it or not.      I believe we should not have that right to pull thing off of shelves freely. If we had that right it would cause problems from many stand points if you think about it.         One problem it could cause is people thoughts towards a book, movie, cd and so forth. If one person looks at and is like 'I don't like this and this about it.' and then just pulls it of the shelf, then thats one less things for somebody who does like it. Now since that person doesn't like what the material offers to the public, doesn't mean somebody else dosen't. Nobody in this entire world is exactly the same. Every body in this world has their likes and dislikes. If they had the freedom to take things, then there would be nothing for anybody to read, listen too, watch, eat etc.          You also have to think how would that affect the business of stores, libraries, and other businesses. If everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read. If a business is not making any money, then they're going to have to be closed down. Ecspecially in today economy no business wants to run low on money.        In Katherine's article at the end she said 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is basicly reiterating what I said earlier about peoples likes and dislikes about everything. If you don't want your kids or anybody else kids looking at something you believe is offensive. You should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section. Like a section for older kids and people.     Mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at. You're the ones to raise them the way you want to raise. If you think they are to young for something then thats when you tell them no or whatever. We should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf. Books, movies, music and etc. are for entertainment. If it doesn't entertain you does not mean it does not for anybody else

There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern

'@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1'          @CAPS1  people have @CAPS1 types of genres of books, music, movies, etc., that they like as well as @CAPS1 they don't like. Meaning that its up to you what you like and you are @ORGANIZATION1 forces to read or listen to anything you don't want to. Books, music, and other entertaining things are here as an @ORGANIZATION1 so if you dont like it then you don't have to deal with it.     I feel that it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary that books should be removed from the shelves  just because someone has gotten offended @ORGANIZATION1 it. You were @ORGANIZATION1 told that it is a must to read that book and it wasn't the company nor the author's fault that you rented the book and you felt insulted. Most likely there were @ORGANIZATION1 directing the story towards you so why get all worked up over something that has happen to you and take it out on the media?  You chose it @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. Why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of @ORGANIZATION1 simply taking it back where you got it from?      I have read @CAPS1 books, listened to @CAPS1 songs, and seen lots of movies that weren't in my best interest but I didn't make them stop saling them because i'm pretty sure someone out there likes it. Why stop someone elses enjoyment because of my uninterest? It's really @ORGANIZATION1 that neccesary. And that's the problem in the world today, people take little situations into a big catastraphy for no reason. If you don't like it then don't get it. People need to put their feet in the company's shoes and realize that if it was them, they would understand.      Books, magazines, music, movies, etc., are made for everyone in the world to make entertainment for those who are interested. Taking them off the shelves would be more than unnessecary just because some person doesn't like it. People have different opinions about life and that's what makes every indiviual different from one another. So why ruin other people's fun just to get what you want?     As I stated before for it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something. It's @ORGANIZATION1 the company's fault so just simply don't buy it or take it back. Things would be so much better. Get the items that best fits you and leave the others that don't on the shelves.

Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary? Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary. For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc. The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book. Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please.          I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like.      If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories. Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel.      So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind

There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.     In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.     Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it.     I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.     So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them

I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society. The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great

Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion.

Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library.  Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide.  Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting.  There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious.  Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors.  People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she @MONTH1 want to read.     Never, will one book bind the world.  Minds of human beings are too complexly separated.  For example; reading '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON2 in my @CAPS3 class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class.  Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's.  Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done.  There will always be that one person who declines to agree.     It is a choice.  It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read.  If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom?  Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the @CAPS4 faith will not be stood for by the reader.  Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point.  To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story.  A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read.     Finding an appropriate book is not the problem.  That has yet to become the problem.  The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling.  I find '@CAPS5 in the @CAPS6' to be dangerously inappropriate.  However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions.  Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content.  Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive.  There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it.  To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other.     To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires.  Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down.  Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously.  Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf everytime someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone.  As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice.  Every human mind desires the freedom to choose.  Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they @MONTH1 be interested in.  Let readers have their freedom.

In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     '@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book

I think alot of books are good to read cause some of them will tell you more wat u didnt know so thierfore u might pick up a book that u like and read it andyou @MONTH1 like it but doesnt have more meaning to  what your reading alot of books you read have some type of character in it that might talk about another thing thats opposite then what the other charcter is talking about magazines show you sometimes wat the persons life style is like some books that people read has no action or felling in it so they can just pick up and read the book its always good to pick up a reasonable  book so someone can read books thats positive and would mean something to other people to read the same book you read i think the best book is one that tells you about life and what you need to know to suceed life you @MONTH1 run in to a book that is true and get into it so you can learn sometimes about what you read and write about it on a essay paper a magazine and movie book shows alot of action and wat its like what they do most people migh think its boring to read a unaction book so they get a book that they have action to so it might exsite them more than a regular book but most books have more pictures than words in it you should take a book off the shelf that has wat  you need to know about cause action books might not help you all the time the more action fun books you read are not as good as wat another book is taking place at in a stor

In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     Removing items from shelves removes history.  Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    Think about it.  If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  It would cause much argument among people.  Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  People read for enjoyment and knowledge.  They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it.

Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.

Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian.      Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room.      Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words.      Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age. As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read.      Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that @MONTH1 seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that.      Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available.      So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains

Do I believe that some books should be taking off the shelves if they are found offensive ?     Well what do you think ? I think they should depending on cause or what degeree of the party being offended. I feel if there are books ,movies,or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended.      If you have a racist book against all races like blacks,asian,or mexican etc... other minorities @MONTH1 find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves.      If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent . Also, if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business.      So to avoid all of the fighting and  lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites. If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well.           Plus , they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty srticken towns, homes countries. I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways  that is what makes us who we are today.

Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.     If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.    For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.     I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.      We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them

Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people. If one book is discriminating against another indivual is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons.       First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect. They don't have to read,watch,or listen to it. Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person.     Second, this can be there for purpose. The @LOCATION2 wasn't always a equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed. From slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can looked on upon.     Third reason, is a library is suppose to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect. If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If theres no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether its on how to do hair to the hitsory of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     In conslusion, these reason make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to a ivdivual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Thrid, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are ligetament resaons why it should be left alone

In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence. Theses books all have history in them of our past. We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historains say, history repeats its self. If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgoten, and/or lost.      Libraries can help us in many different ways. They help us with school projects, bussiness projects, and libraries better our knoweldge as a person. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offesive. The stories of slavory are still taken offensively amoug people @DATE1, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the poeple, we will slip back into that terrible past.      There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better.      There is more than just books at the public library, there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the @CAPS3. Movies that talk about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2. These types of movies can show how horrifying @CAPS4 really is and how cruel people can get. During @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2, there was the @CAPS9 where six million jews lost their lives because one person, @PERSON2, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the @CAPS3 how devestating man can be but people have made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example @PERSON1. One of the greatest findings amoug the @CAPS3.      Music can also be a good way to better ones self. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You dont have to worry about payin for a @MONEY1 cd and you can use it until your done with it then return. Then with how advanced our technokwledge is, people can get cd's to burn on to a computer and put on their ipod or @NUM4 player. Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like.      So, should there be censorship in our libraries? NO! There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our @CAPS3, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of @DATE1 from history we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or gaurdian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from readin to mature thing but still able to get the history he/she needs because as historains always say, history repeats its self and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible. The answer to that is through our history.

I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer

Hi im henry and I agree that if there are books in a school libray or a public libray that are offensive they should be removed. im a type of person who belives that offensive books shouldnt be in librays because i ahte seeing people upset or mad  because they read a book that effened them. That inclues magazines and movies and even music.       myself henry has read a few books that has effened my self or has made fun of black people and i have black friends. if I could have it my way i would have all books like that out of school librays and public librays. And i say that because little kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. thats just like music now days you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you cant understand what there saying half the time. They need to put on music that u can understand that doesnt have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music.     magazines, I look at alot of magazines my self but there all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones lookin for tires or somthing like that. but yes also the bad magazines need t go to that way little kids arent looking at them. also it mite help some crime to stop to. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to. So people see that and there like i wanna try this somtime. so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble. so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change. make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the  naughty things out of book,magazines,music.     Movies, this is a big one just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if u look. but i dont know how we could change the movies by anycahnce at all.     That was my opion on things. i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things.

Why censore something that someone worked hard on? People put up money and countless amounts of time to write this and yet you want to censore it.See there is honestly no need to censore any thing in the library because there certain sections for certain people therefore this whole conversation shouldnt be going on in the first place.People just like to knit pick about what they can not handle for instense like the word nigger i dont like it at all but i can handle it and therfore i just shut my mouth and suck it up.So I just feel like all the critique and all the imature people just need not to read or dont go to the library but thats only me though.So stop acting like little children the authors want their stuff on shelves and not being banned and raved and ranted about alsoIn conclusion stop being imature and if you dont like it dont read it. Always think to yourself about what your doing before you decside

I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies,magazines ,etc should be removed from the shelfs if they are found offensive.  I think offensive books movies music and etc should be removed from shelfs becasue that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something innoproperiate its okay to watch . I would not want my brother or sister to watch, or see anything thing that is not approperiate.  I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and step dad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1,@CAPS1 or @NUM1 on my television, They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2 and it was innoproperiate in their opinion. I disagreed with that, I thought I should have the right to have watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch. Everything that was on @CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion. When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1 every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2.   Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe i would think what i see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing . I was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad

TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.  This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community

Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the self.     First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the self. All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war. They will say that it infensive on them on take them off. I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake. If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost.     Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self. All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done. It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down how can the football players, solders, and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight.     Finally, they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms. Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise. Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company.     All of this is why i don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad.

Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy.

Yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human etc. but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gonna learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good. Really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them.

If I was to right about to a news paper that are childing should not be looking at book and shoud be tacken off the shelf. The reson I say that is so are cirlden are not geting ideads from a book that is not aproprit for them. I thank that is the mane reson there are more girls geting pragnit at a young age. I thank if we were to tack off the notey book there would be less girls pragnet.     I realy thank it could work if we would tack all of the notey books off the shelf and mack it a law that you hade to be a sherton age to look at them. I would like to see a chang in the way we look at notey book. I thank you should be @NUM1 to look at books that are notey. It would be a good thang to try for a wiyel. I thank it woukd work because it would not been showin to are childer and they would not whant to have babys as a teenager.     This is the way I thank it should have been done in the farist place. We would not have so miny probloms in the frist place. The than is I thank thay not thak it well be to hard to race a chiled at a young age. If we would not have to see thans that we shouldent have seen.

Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature.  Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to.  Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about.  Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society.     In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story.  Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions.  @PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them.  The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society.  When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy.  @PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless.  So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading.  Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.     The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world.  What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day.  In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved.  In a normal society, learning leads to questioning.  But for them there is no learning, just accepting.  And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.     The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways.  To them, death is not a big deal.  @PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it.  Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to.  At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes.  The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday!  A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.      Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer.  Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about.  Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once.  But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well.

Do i think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves just becuase they are offensive? No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down befor even reading it your self is stupied on be hafe of your part becasue maby other people like and maby you like it who knows. I just think that people should realy think befor they go and take something off the shelves with out haveing alote of people giveing you a bad coment on it befor just taking one persons opean on it.

Offensive or @CAPS1?     Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1

As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically

Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it.

Censorship?  What is it?  Well from what i know cenorship is where you are blocked from certin things that you are not able to ever bring into the place that blocked it.  So the question is it wrong to censor something or not, i think that libraries should be able to censor certins things that people find offensive.  First reason why i think it is right that people should be able to censor things is becuase little childeren could be able to take at peek at what they shouldn't be looking at, when it comes to magazines and also movies.  Next reason why i think labraries should be able to cenor is because people can find centin things offensive just as music, for example like vulgar language can be listened to and aslo also naughty things can be watched in movies.  My last reasoning why i think it is fair that libraries are able censor things is beacuase some people like to read but in thier reading can be bad things that they find offensive and they can always find a way to take an item out from a labrary.  These are reasons why i think they should be able to censor books, music, movies, and also magazines.     My first reasoning in why i think it is fair that libraries are able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines is because little childeren could be able to look at things things they should not be able to take a peek at.  Thses things could be like pronogaphy, and also really grusome things in magazines and in movies.  If these things were in labraries they can possibly show other childeren, inwhich it would not be good.  This can be a problem beacuase parents can put the blame on the libraries by saying that the workers didn't do a good job at watching out for the children.  Also i think think they should be able to censor movies beacuse little childern shouls not be watching gursome movies at a young age.  This can really hurt them and others if they learn and see what is on this movies and magazines.  Also labraries can censor music.      I also think libraries can censor music beacause in music these days there are very bad things that any body can find that is offensive.  Little childern can be listenig to vulgar lyrics that are in the songs and they could be repeating it to other people.   This can be bad in many ways because first of all they might not know what they are saying,  so if one day they say it to an adult, that adult can put the blame on the library owners.  Also they should be able to censor movies again beacuse naughty things can be shown in those movies that certin age levels should not be able to see.  These are ressons why libraries have a right to censor music and movies.   They aslo have right to censor books.      Books in they libraries are great but some books should not be able to be in a library, certin books such as books about faith and other religions.  And also about gursome items.  Some people can find books about religion and faith to be very offensive because some people @MONTH1 not see eye to eye about other religions.  And to minimize this problem libraries can take these books out so peolpe won't find it be offensive.   And also libraries should be censoring certin books about death because it can really get to a person and they can show other people that will find it very offensive.  So this is why i think libraries should be able to censor things.     In conclusion libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines, because in some books they can have religion problems and problems with death,  movies beacuse in some movies it can show pronography and gursome things that peopel should not be watching,  and they should be able to censor magazines and music beacuse in magazines childern could be looking at certin things they shouls not be looking at.  And they should be able to censor music beacuse peopel can be offended if they ever listen to vulgar language.  So in other words i do think libraries should be able to censor books, music, movies, and magazines

Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. ' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book.      I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4

Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!

Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  If we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. This will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.

Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others. Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves? There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored. However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored.     The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up.  A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer. There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored. Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across. I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across. If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library.      As people can see library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information. There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive. If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no. I just gave you some reasons why I would say that. The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important.

Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there.  She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove.     They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it.     We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off. That why i think they should be remove

Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.

Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and innappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons. Some of these reasons are frivelous and should not keep a book from reaching it's full potential. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line, and are banned. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves.     If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author @MONTH1 have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work @MONTH1 be recognized. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves.     Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read.     If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone. Just because a book contains a few areas where innappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book @MONTH1 have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make.     Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives. In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one.

I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually.     The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose.           The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read.      Then the third  is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose.     The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book.      Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship. The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says.

I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library.     Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library.     Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care.    Thoma

I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it. There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books     If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book.     It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper.     Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them.     So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book

Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers

Curse words, alcohol, drugs, pornigraphic pictures. These are all things you would not like your children to use, see, or do. They are out in the world and and there is nothing that you can do to stop it. People do drugs and drink everyday, but just because someone sees you doing it doesnt mean they will too.     People should not be shielded from the real aspects of life. When shielded as a child they would not know what do to if the chances came to them to do drugs or drink. They @MONTH1 not even know what the right or wrong thing to do is. Kids to a certain age deserve to know whats going to happen in the real world when they grow up and start a life. It won't happen to everyone but they need to know these things.     It is important for parents to let their children know what is right or what is wrong. As an adolesent, they are very vulnerable to all the bad stuff that life can bring. Seeing these things in books, movies, magazines and etc. will effect their life in some way. It is their job to show them the right path.     A thing that helps these parents are restrictions on the stuff that you are able to get your hands on. On movies there are age restrictions that inable people at a certian age to be able to watch and people that are within those guidelines to have access. With other materials like books, music, and magazines, there is no way to deny access to people to see or read them. Parents just need to be observent to their children and see what they do.      Censorship is normally a bad thing, but in others it could help. For people that are more vulnerable to those situations or seeing those things, it could greatly help with some people and show them that it is not right. As much as people should be open and be able have access to this information, it is also important that other people did not see it. It is still an open debate, but, in opinion, censorship should not be done. Everyone had their own right to get and see the things they want

In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval.     The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader.     The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it.     Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's.     Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.

Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.      Who can be the ultimate decision maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?

Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around @NUM1 old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responibliltys. He wants to try new things. He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He dosnt no something is bad about it or not. No one every told him. So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places

Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?     When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it
<START>

If you take any of these books off the shelves that would be lik taking away some of our chilldhood. that wuldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was yoour favorite book as a kid.      We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore. the had to make room for other books. So if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books.       I mean how wuld you fel if you couldnt share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me and i went out and got them from the library and I loved them to So please if you can leave the books alone

What is a library?  A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment.  Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended

Cennsorship in Libraries       To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count. It really has to depend on what the product is. Such as a book, magazine, music album, or a movie. Usually in any store i've walked into, there are certain departments for each product. In these seperate departments, the product is always catagorized. Not from what people like, but by genera or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like.      A local library in a persons commuinty will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just me. However the generation under me will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else.     Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears.      Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie. For them, it's only @NUM1 movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies arn't allowed to be rented by a younger person. Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them.     Overall a persons opinion will be the most important one to them. Other opinions wont matter. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge. If absolutly everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left

I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library.  It simply isnt right to withold information from your children.  Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway.  Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd?  Then they can ask parents any questions that they @MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.     If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know?  Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong.  Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?     Any of the things that they @MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet.  On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects.  Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites.      When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in @NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read.  I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things.  I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus.  What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.      What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear.  It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision?  If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions.  Explain things to them when they ask you a question.  Don't beat around the bush.  Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it

No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.

In this persuasive essay i'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that. I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries.      My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs. I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future.     My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo, because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive.      Also if we do, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's, books, and movies.     People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home. So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book. Scary movies are not real and some books too. There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies, but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies.      To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries, beacuse it will hurt others, and theres just no need in it

When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. When I see that, I  think, '@CAPS1 if a child saw this?' I would like a library for my child to visist without me worrying about the things they could see.To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things.     First off, the libraries could censor @CAPS1 they put out on the selves. By putting the adult books section by the check out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section. If that soultion does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies. Put @CAPS2 books and movies together, @CAPS2- @DATE1 books and movies together, @CAPS4- @CAPS5 books and movies together, and so on.      One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did.     I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice. So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff.

Should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. Removing teh  books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.     I would not want my @NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it. Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not.     I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things. I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life. We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids. If we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things. So lets get the fi,ltering satrted and save the world and our kids future.

Thoughts of @CAPS1    I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of @CAPS1 is particularly offensive; the piece should not be displayed. From my own experience, controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing. That one thing being, pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensiveness.     From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading. I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy.     Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them. Though my observations @MONTH1 seem one-sided. I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'.     The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definetly be @CAPS2 @NUM1. In said novel society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables. From stories, such as the three little pig and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct.     Pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text; the book must be stripped from the public. As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace. I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality.
<START>

People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will

Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally I don't think they should be. If @CAPS3 is something in the book that is remotelly offensive towards children then it should be put under a section for adults only.  Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If @CAPS3 is a book that is racially unexceptable then it should be put in the adult section not anywhere for children.      When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not they should review all the possibilities of how someone @MONTH1 comprehend the story to see their reaction with it. @CAPS3 are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so @CAPS3 is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in @CAPS1 we just finished reading the book '@CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 is a lot of question if the book should be read in schools or not because of the 'n-word'. It is a very harsh word, but it goes with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is not sure if a book is acceptable or not they should take in concideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is needed or not. In many cases the unexceptable thing @MONTH1 work along with the story.     If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It is all about the audience who reads that certain book if it is appropriate or not to the person reading it. I have read many books that have certain words that don't bother me, but someone else who isn't use to it @MONTH1 not like. Some parents don't want their kids hearing foul language or inappropriate stuff from the type of music they listen to. It all comes down to who reads the book or magazine, and who listens to the music. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking the books off of the shelves then eventually @CAPS3 wouldn't be any books left on the shelves anymore. Just becasue something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from peoples enjoyment!
<START>

If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it?     Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them?  What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive?     I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today.  '@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies.  There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them.     You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes.  What would there be left to watch?  If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself.  Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone.     My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see.  Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what?  It has worked so far, so why should we change it?

I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it.     Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album.     There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all

A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?     Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.     But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.     In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.     In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.

Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books.

The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them

I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons. The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.     I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information.     To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information.

Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.

People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.

There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them.      In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating. In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of.      Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials.

Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books. In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they @MONTH1 not be familier with, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic.      A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax. If your going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic.      If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books. I think this because I dont think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it.      Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgable about the innappropriate, or offensive topics.      In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library censored, would be a mistake. It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgable about different topics. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work

No, cause if that is the case evry  book you read could be offense to somebody. If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama. Third reason every could be offense to somebody.          First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last.     Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author.     Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary. Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book.

In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes. But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter? Thats the question. Some might find it offensive and others @MONTH1 not. It all depends on the person. Libraries cant please everyone.      In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys. Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs.     Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials.Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who dont' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem.      If this solution doesn't work there are many more. The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all.      Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials. Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one.
<START>

Yes  I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out  the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this.     If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken  off the shelf. I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired.     My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is.

Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people.
<START>

I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be some where the kid shouldnt be able to get it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed. So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books.     The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them.     In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the @CAPS1 for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that @CAPS1 that is bad it is the parents fault. But i think that the @CAPS1's for little children should be in one part of the store and the @CAPS1's for the older people should be where the can get access to it.     This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, @CAPS6, and even for @CAPS7 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form @LOCATION1@NUM1 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see. Like in the @CAPS7 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under @NUM3 shouldnt see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores. So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies.     The reason i explained all of this is so children dont get ahold of them. Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else. Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie. And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff.

Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people.

Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive

I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take @CAPS1 easy on me.      Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored.       @CAPS1 is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course.      The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1: @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them

There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines,ect., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constanly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents @MONTH1 not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material @MONTH1 be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.     One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way. If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.      It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers.      If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another persons favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.     There is a variety of materials available to the public that @MONTH1 be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, ect.

I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or where ever and there are books,movies, magazines, or cd's that you think are offensive that they should most likley be taken off of the shelf.     Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not approprite for little kids, and you get a little embarassed yourself?I know I have at least one point and time in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves.     I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they new what kind of music most teen's are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isnt appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about.      Some people feel differant about this, and some people take it a little to serious, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion

Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.

When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this
<START>

Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools.          There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it.
<START>

I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else

In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do.

There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them

Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open.  You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media.  The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever.  This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.     Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple.  In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press.  By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble?  As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation.     By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically.  For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith.  If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information.  If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.     Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1.  Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries.  This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place.  The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few.       In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few.  This is not what our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 envisioned @LOCATION2 to become and they were right.  Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong

Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not. Books are known to do this to people. However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people. There are even books read in school classrooms that offend people. Reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it, they will come across one that offends them. I believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books who offend people, music and movies have censorship, and if they don't like it they should ignore it.     First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books. Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but deal with it anyway. That's what this is. Even though there are the handful out there that don't like those certain books, those books are the ones that are well liked and become famous. I have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books I have read. To sum that all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only few left.      Secondly,  music and movies have censorship. You can choose whether you want that censorship or not. Movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies. Music blocks out the words that need to be. If they don't want it they don't have to listen to it or watch it. We all have the certain things we love and hate, we can't eliminate all of the hated things.     Last of all, in my opinion if they don't want it they don't have to have it. The music and movies are an option to people, they don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea. It's all opinionated, there isn't a right or wrong to it. I know of people out there who don't have @CAPS1's or they don't listen to the radio, that's perfectly fine. They don't have to complain about because they don't pay any attention to it.     To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if they can't stand it they don't have to deal with it. As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc. are very well liked by many of people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended? We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public

The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.

So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.

Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another

In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it. Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines. Everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books.          Libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay?  Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. Just like how they have an adult and children section. Everyone has a place were that feel like they belong. Even if some people get offended. A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style.      I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course. Nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.      In the times that I've been to the library there @MONTH1 be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go I always find  my style of music that appeals to me. Not just the same thing everywhere I go. Theres always a choices, different options and more things I can learn about.     Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone. I person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book. Where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything

This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.      The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. The sections are split into children , teens , and adults . I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't

I think we should not take it off the shelf beacus what @MONTH1 be offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to me. or some thing that fun or i think or beneficial to me. and what @MONTH1 be offensive to me @MONTH1 not be offensive to you. And i think if some thing are offensive to some one thay should just walk off, or just dont mind i

I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.

Have you ever been at the library and asked yourselve any of the following questions? Who reads this? Why is it here? Are kids reading or watching this stuff? Do kids check these out? Or have you ever wondered or said to your self any of these statements? I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this. This is so offensive. This goes against all our morals. I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it. Lets get out of here. This place is wack. Ever consider what books get banned from the library? Who bans the books?          I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put a age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I dont think the cussing books are that offensive. When the person (No matter who it is)goes out into the world. They are going to learn and hear curse words. People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them till thier grave. Wheather they chose to use them or not that's thier choice.        For them to be banned or moved to a diffrent group of books they should have to be sexist, raciest, have alot of sex, or just really grusome. I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western. I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area. The staircase should be by the circulation desk. When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there.      I think The top level or a certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey dovey stuff, they have cow boy shoot off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really raciest, or really sexist, or grusome stuff like people killing people for fun.Also they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what im talking about. You know how you go down a aisl at the @CAPS1 market and there are girls in thier bikini and half naked. Then there are the cosomos both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasureable sex. I would hate for some little @NUM1 year old or @NUM2 year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life.      Then the main level or area should be teen books. You know vampire books, @CAPS1 heros, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children level. Games puppets and movies and easy books. That about sums that up.      I dont think just anybody should be able too ban a book. I think it should be open but not just anyone. There should be a huge meeting. With the mayor, a couple teachers one english teacher from each level, and parents, and the librabiens. The person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.
<START>

Censorship in the libraries. Do you think that we should be able to take movies, magizens, and books off the shelf. There are many different arguments about this subject.     I believe if they put the books, movies, and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others. They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world. because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older. I think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it.     Some people @MONTH1 say that we are two young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better of you will be when you get older.      So that is my input on the situation. the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff
<START>

I think that certain materails should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music. If we where to listin to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read. For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it. A person that @MONTH1 come in the library daily @MONTH1 want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes.     Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and there children were watching movies about gangs,drugs,and violence, the mother would want that movie removed from the library. I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are cought watching it. Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with there children.A way for the library to stop children from geting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched. Many people like movies with drugs, and violence. There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certian thing.     I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it. And if they say there children watch it or read it without there permission then that is there fault and they should know more about what there young children are doing instead of trying to get that book, movie removed sometimes books and movies have very offensive languge but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world. They want the movie or book to be as real as posssible.
<START>

Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or unappropiate for certain ages can be controlled.      Movie theatres, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaraunts or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you @MONTH1 be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well you @MONTH1 be right, but you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropiate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theatre. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomial compared to what it is. Would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon?      I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age appropiate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers' for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material.      Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropiate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sacks. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library are underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled

Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accomadate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why?     Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the '@CAPS1 child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.     Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.     Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of @LOCATION1. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.     Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it.
<START>

I dont think there should be any censorship good books and music shouldint be removed just becaus one person finds it offensive. Becaus the opinion's of one @MONTH1 be diffrent with another.I beleave music is cencord the most becaus  not many people get offendid by books but censorship in music i think is destroying it.Becaus its an artists way of expresion and if people dont wana listen to what there saying then they should just not listen to it.Books i think shouldint be taken offensivly forthe same reason music shouldint its a writers oppinion and expresion its like telling someone they cant voice there oppinion on anything like racesim or use curse words if they want.

To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries.  I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  @CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.
<START>

Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons.

Going to the library you would think of it as an family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think or offenceive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly many of the libraries do and I do not think that they should be alouded to, since it is not aimed just for adults.     Children loved to go to the library to check out books and many more things that they  enjoy, but a five year old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else for that matter descrimanting against the other gender or another race. These materials should not be able to sit apon the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or the library owners wouldn't let there own children read it so why should it be okay for someone else child to read or watch it.  I'm not the only one who thinks this, I am sure that there are millions of people like me that would not appericiate their loved ones finding these things and reading them.        The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when there are old enough. Theses places are supposed to be an family place where you can go to get information not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racistism, and any other diragotori subjects. Young kids are not the only ones that should not be reading these cruptied material; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand it better and take the subjects into account.     I am begging these library owners to please take these offensive materials out of their branches; not only because small children could see them, but adults does not need to be reading, listening, or watching these things either. If you would not want oyur child to why would anyone else want their child too?
<START>

Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me i think they should leave @CAPS1 up their. I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there. Not only is @CAPS1 happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also.     Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take @CAPS1 offensive when they see something thats against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about @CAPS1. I say, 'If  you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get @CAPS1 just beacuse you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1. So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1?' @CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said a pastor was on tv, talkin about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad. He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off tv. But she didn't havve to watch him on tv, she could of watched something else. Nobody made her watch @CAPS1, she chose to watch @CAPS1.     So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you.

Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have.      Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research.      I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together.      The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are.      In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive. It is their job to just offer information
<START>

I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked. The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored.     I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is. Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6,@CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone.     People learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way,we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future.

Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened.     If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else.      Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy.      Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead  of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.
<START>

There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazins, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet,even some words in songs. Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self.      A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with.     Also if  evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending. It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites.     Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn alot of this through the media. As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed?      If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media. So now i ask you, what do you think
<START>

At my point of viwe i think if materials such as books is offensive to the reader the reader shuld just leve the book allown.Because other readers might just wont to read it.Same thing for music,movies,and magazines, or any thing else just because you fide some offensive it wont be right to take it away from @NUM1,ooo of more people.Also i think if some is offensive to more then one person it shuld not just not be taking away right then in there we as people shuld step up in have a vote or talk about it about the problem.I think it just wont be right for us or to the rest of the wrold and then look at how much work the author hade to put in i never wrot a book but i also know it's not easy to do.Heres a example me and my family want out to eat but we dent no were to eat at so every body was thinking about pizzy but my big brother dent wont to so we dent go out to eat that night because of one person dent wont to thats not fair now is it. So in my conclusino i dont think its wood be ringht to take some away because some body fund it offensive you just got to look at the rest of the wrold you just got to because it wont right  to the rest of us.

The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.

Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.

The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.

There are thousands of books in libraries, which are inapproriate and some that are. But libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for  random information. Libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else. We need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intellegent.       I believe that all books in a library have a purpose. They @MONTH1 be offensive but they teach us many things. For example, there are books out there that talk about the @CAPS1. For some people this @MONTH1 be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then. Books can teach us so much about the past, we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world.      I also think that all books have a purpose to them. whether they are fiction or nonfiction. You @MONTH1 ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' @CAPS2, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination, quite a bit of books make us relieze that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life. And the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our childrens attention. Fiction books are the first books children know how to read, this is where they start their reading skills.      My last reason for why I don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intellegent. We learn so much information from all sorts of books. Another example would be, that @CAPS3 books could be 'offensive' as @CAPS2, but if we didn't have them we would not have intellegent doctors. My final reason why I disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others. What I mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive.     Every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not. But why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves? Just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it. Everyone has different taste, we wont ever agree on anything. But removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone. Yes, they @MONTH1 be unsuited for others but when we don't like some thing don't we just move along to something we do like? Yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books

No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music , movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Here are statements on why i believe this.          First, I think if you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things then dont read the part that is offensive to you. If you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it? If you believe this is offending you then put it down and forget about it, you dont have to read or watch it. I think if you are reading or watching it, then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it.         When does anyone even write about offending things lately anyway? Like I said before if you are reading or watching or whatever it is then it is your own fault, @CAPS1 states that when one of you states you have been offended you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives.Well it stops today I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do.           If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then do it, but remember of what your taking away from those who like to read all of that.If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us.          I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone.I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about your taking away from those who read, listen or watch these things. Take in order of what I have said, goodnight.

Libraries @CAPS1't Remove Books     @CAPS2 i would like to start off this story by stating i don't believe that libraries should remove books if they are offensive. If a book is offensive thats not a reason to take it off the shelves we watch movies in school today showing the past when @LOCATION1 had slaves.     I myself don't believe it is fair to show a movie in school about slavery but we cant have a book that doesnt actually show anything to us just tells us whats going on. In my eyes a book is less harmless then wating a show on the subject. A movie can show alot more detail in it then a book can so i say let the books stay where they are. Don't try to shut down a author beacuse you dont like what they wrote their might be more meaning in the book then you can see. Just keep reading you never know how the story might go on. Just like dont judge a book by its cover.     We @CAPS1't take away a book someone might like. Someone might hate the book but beacuse they hate it would you quit reading it? I don't believe it is right to remove something beacuse someone might not like what is it saying. i myslef see alot of things i don like everyday but i do not try getting everything changed. This is life as i know it there is alot of offencive people in this world and it wont change anytime soon not for me or anyone. Unless they make a law against being offencive.     I can see someone in a band saying something offencive about someone but we cant not sell his cd's beacuse someone might like what he said in that song. Or i dont like alot of shows and or movies on tv but i dont try to get the station shut down i just change the channel. As should lets say someone in a book store sees a offencive book they should just look away. Not go and try to get it shut down.     All i can really say tho is that i couldnt tell you what i would do beacuse i dont read very many books so i dont see them being offencive. So i can not tell you i wouldnt be mad but i still would just put the book down and not touch it again.

I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place.

Books are books we all read them and summary's over them. To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly whats going on todays life. So we shouldnt take books off the shelfs just like magizens. They might have information to tell people around the world. Thats why people make books and magizens so people like us can read them while were notbusy in life or just relaxin.      People read bad stuff all the time in books or magizens thats what life is about cause there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life. I mean hey if you dont want your children readin them than have them not read at all. Because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life. There's stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them. When there at that age in there life so there going to find out some how or another. Cause there are schools that have alot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for there future's.Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history  clases. That talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad. When kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble.      So if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it. History classes are very helpfull because  they teach you about all the different wars. That has happend and who invaded other countrys or states. They help out on findin places on a maps. That shows all the wolds state and countrys and even where we live in our country.     So really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them. Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and there time makin books.  Then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf. What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff  in a little writing.  Whats the harm in it anyway

For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it @MONTH1 be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship.     Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels.  Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want thier feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason.      Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material.     There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely.     It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorhip of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.

Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.      Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.     Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.     People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.      The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others.

Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
<START>

I think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for. If we started putting movies in the librarys why put books in the libraries. I think it should be one or the other. If movies were in libraries i think that people would get more movies than books, and just think how it would be if you put music in a library also. I do think that a magazine is a book.     Movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater. not in libraries. Music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries. People would lose intrest in books if people started putting movies and music in libraries. I think they are trying to put technology in libraries and im not for that.     If music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books. We need books they are the oldest but most acreart way to express yourself or tell a story. but now they want movies or music.

Cencorship     The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good.     The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad. The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily. Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't.      In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor. Such as political cartoon. They make fun of the @CAPS1 and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it. In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it. That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again.     But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended. Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies. I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough. most people can live with it, but others can't. Such as @CAPS2, there is a whole lot of @CAPS2 in the @LOCATION1, and expecally in this time period. where ever you go there is always some sort of @CAPS2.     In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far. and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything
<START>

Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right.     Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.     Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.     Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.     In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Then material should be suppervised by my parents.

Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries?     Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects. I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, @CAPS1, sex, etc. Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though. They might as well get ahead start on it now. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they @MONTH1 need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on '@CAPS1' for a project im doing in @CAPS2 class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from.     On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/@CAPS1. Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you.      If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature. You have to expect that from kids now a days. No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn

NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc. should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in many ways. Music helps people find their activity in many ways. Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done.      The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better. It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was. Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did.      Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc. Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint. When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer.      Last but not least, magizines. Magizines gives you alot of information that one @MONTH1 be seeking for. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote. Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed. When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price. There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine. So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library.      With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else. Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc. Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc. Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc. When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music. All  these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you. All of these things can help you in a way

There are people that are officave to all kinds of people. So what will make it different if someone writes a book that someone else doesn't like it should not matter if someone does not agree with someone else desion on a book cause someone else might like his or her book.There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc that someone will not like that is just part of life it you ask me. So i think haveing books that some people dont like is a great thing to have in are world. It tell you whether people are going out to see what is going on in are world if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people.There is just one thing that people should allows keep in mind when they are write a movie or even in your local new paper the articles that some people put in the movies and papers are taking a little to far sometimes by what people say. I do bevlive that there should be a line as to what you can and not write in a book and i think that should be deminded by the write of his best judgement.Why do some people complane about everything that is meant to be told to them is because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they dont want other people to know there past if it is bad or of sumthing tragic has happend top them whether it be in ther family something bad happend to them but i think if somebody would talk to this person they would not get so mad at someone for speeching the truth to the public.Well you have heard my side of the store on what i think about peoplle getting mad at other people for what they say and i belive that what you say is very true that we do ahve a freddom in this country.

Censorship seems like a great idea at first thought!  It allows parents to have their children closely monitored without actually monitoring them.  Consequently, censorship in libraries creates the possibilty for every book ever written to be removed from shelves around the world.  There are multiple things wrong with the idea of censorship.  It creates objections due to differences in opinions and autors being completely and uterly offended.  Censorship is a disgrace and should not be forced in libraries.     People have different criteria when it comes to deciding a level of offensiveness.  For intsense, if a fifty-year-old @CAPS1 female read a violent book with some curse words and sexual content she might think that it was offensive.  Likewise, if a twenty-one-year-old, careless male read the exact same book he would probably enjoy its content.  This defference in opinion poses as a huge problem in allowing libraries to censor their selecion.  I feel that it would be unfair to remove books that some audiences would enjoy.     Instead of completely banning some texts, why not move them to another section of the library?  Libraries could take some time to separate the books into categories and the books that they feel are offensive could go into a separate section of the library.  This section could be as simple a separate shelf, or could go to the extreme of a separate room or area closed in by a curtain.  Either way, completely getting rid of books because of their content is a terrible idea.     Authors could potentially lose money from the action of censorship.  They put in numberous hours and a lot of effort to write books and novels.  Some spend years trying to perfect their masterpieces.  Magazines and movies provide the same amount of time, but they also aquire an unimagineable amount of money.  If these authors, directors, and producers have their specific product taken off of the shelves it would be offensive to them.  They could have a decrease in sales which would cause a decrease in money as well.  The idea is simply unfair.     Librarians have the right to display the content of which they choose, but making them remove products that they feel are fine is ridiculous.  I think that censorship is a terrible idea.  If anything should be banned from a library it should be censorship itself!

Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right. It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others. I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier.     Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories. People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else. Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand. They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others.     Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way. People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions.     Some people are just stubborn. They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others.     In conlusion I do think censorship is important but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas. If people sought to understand, ;ooked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better

I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content

I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc

When people  think of libraries  they picture  this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet.Or they just picture this books every where . But libraries today has be way more improved and advance with music,movies,and etc.     When i was  young I never really like libraries  because they seem boring to me.Thats why I wasn't good read either until I was in the six grade because I discover the library was actually cool place. They different thing to do like look up books,music,or movies  you can check out the libraries. Or sometimes you migth have magazines you can check out too.                                Then at the libraries there people who don't like it because of the music,movies,and etc.This reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens.Thats why the faithful and ones go to the libraries everyday take the new things offense to the library.     When it all boil down this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was offense book talking about the whites treated the negreos back then. The reason say that is because old tradition in the library are like the whites in the story and the  new things in library  are like the negreos who was outcasted by the whites.Then in book it took one little girl to settle diference and knows whats right and wrong.     Thats why I think instead of banning or remove stuff we should have disscusion.Which we can come to adgreement keep new ideas in the libraries.When do keep the ideas maybe we can make a section for thet new ideas so the people comes to library wouldn't get offend

Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons. Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming. Books that have questionable content are being thrown out.     I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they @CAPS5 and if it offends them they can choose by theirselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that @MONTH1 not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I @CAPS5 a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married. Of course the libraries should be seperated into different categories such as: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 at Your Own @CAPS6. Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings, a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated @CAPS7 and know that it is exceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, wether the parent knows it or not.      In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they @CAPS5 and what they @CAPS5 about. Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interprate it.

I belive that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be  offensive.  The main reason I say that is becuase there are not just postive things in this world ,but there are alot of negitves also.  It is very important for children to learn and understand the things that are going on in the world they live in reguardless if they are good or bad.  Everyone is going to have to learn about the things going on around them sooner or later ,so it is better to find it out as a child rather then later on in life when you might not have someone there to explain it all to you.       I understand, there are some age limits that should be inforced becuase of some of the fowl nature of them. Though at some point and time before a child becomes an adult they should know most of the basics of life no matter how positive or negitive. Children should not be shelter at a young age to just young adult things because they need to know what else is out there in the world.  For example, children should be taught that there really are bad people in the world.  If they dont understand that something bad could happen to them beucase they did not know the dangers around them because they never learned it.       When I was younger it was required to know other people out side of your race or religion beucase not just your race or religon is in this world.  Also we learned the diffrence between good and bad choices.  If us children did not learn that at an early age many of them would be in some very rough situations today.     On the other hand there is an extent the children need to learn also.  For example, say you buy a video game for your child ,but make sure you inforce to them that killing and shooting is not something that they should be doing out in the real world.  Make sure you teach them the diffrence between really and fakeness.  That is a main reason why kids today do not have self control becuase of the things they learn off of video games.     Now a days on @CAPS1 there are people being preasured by the media to act out of there charater just to get attation.  They are publicsizing sexual and inapproprate things for child to be learning about at a young age ,but they need to be aware that its out there and it is bad.  In magazines they will destorte famous peoples bodies to make them look like something they are not to make people feel like they are not good enough.  Children sould be taught that not eveything they see, hear ,and read are not always right or true.  With todays media and materials it is easy to know the diffrence between right and wrong ,but they put it out there as if one person is doing it it is ok for everyone to be doing it.  In most cases it is not until that person understand all of the facts about it and can make rashanal dessicions on there own and on there own time.     Children now a days will get  presured by media, magazines ,and sometimes by peers.  The media is telling them to do something that is not neccessarliy right ,but is popular.  You should not teach you children off of things like that it will make them want to do things without thinking or considering what is really going on.  With todays magazines, the writers will make people look like something they really are not just to make them look good.  That is not fair to readers, the person that is being expoused, or the author themself.   Finally, with peer pressure today kids will see something off of television and try it then try and get there friends to do it even though they know it is not the right thing to do.  I belive that children, when they are faced with delimia's like these, should know right from wrong with the trouble they are faceing.  If they know nothing about it they need to walk away or learn how to say no reguardless of how hard it might be.      In conclusion, I believe that the children now a days that are exposed to any type of offensive things should know the meaning behind it.  Also they should know the right ways to haddle it when they are put in certain situations.  Lastly, I believe kids should know what is going on around them so when they grow up they know how to fend for themselves ,and not be counting on someone else to tell them baisc things that are going on in the world around them.

In @DATE1, there are many rap/hip-hop artists. They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. @DATE1 is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not.     I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are ? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.     In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.     Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.     Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.     These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!

My views on censorship, I don't belive in any type of censorship. Books, music, and movies shouldn not be censored.     When it comes to children, it should be the parent's responsability to choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off selves isn't fair to thoose who want to read, watch, or listen to them or to the authors, directors, or musicions.      People should have the freedom to write whatever they want, the reader dosen't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is his freedom to say it

Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.  Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it.   I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.       One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them.  First of all, children often follow after what they see.  For example, adutly trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.     Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music.  Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles.  For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world.  It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment.  Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.     In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do.  Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?  Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.     So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship.  We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries?  Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc.

Censorship. If someone does not like what a book, magazine, movie, etc., shows then they should put it back up and not worry about it. But their are people who do make a big deal about that kinda stuff. Most people who do i personally think are immature.     Censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings, because of nude statues and the way they talked. A lot of the old plays were very sexual and many people find them offensive today. Sometimes their is no way of getting around inapropriate materials. Then their are a lot of people who find those subjects very intersting and like to study it. So by taking those books off the shelf those people would not have any way of researching those materials and therefore they would get upset and complain. The music that is out today has a lot of inapropriate words and sayings in them that would be offensive to most people. But the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it. Most of the time they aren't listening to the words, but just like the beat of the song. Almost all of the older people hate this music and never wanna hear it and think it should be banned. What they dont realize is that if it was taken out of the library their would be more upset and angry people then happy. Magazines and movies today have a lot of inapropriate advertisements and pictures, but now that is what most people like and want to see.      You cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people. Taking all the materials out of the library would most likely take the number of vistors that come to the library go down, because what they are intersted in would not be their anymore so they would have no reason to go anymore. That is what most likely would happen if the books, magazines, movies music, etc., were found offensive and were taking off the shelves
<START>

From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content.  I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive.  It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it.  I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place.          My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended.  I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it.  Why should your opinion speak for everyone else.  Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless.  I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard.          My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library.  They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it.  Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates.
<START>

I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people

Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be with held from people? Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race.     There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn.     Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments and easy to make.     Taking media off the shelves is not needed. The material is not serious enough. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is made forwhat the people want to learn. Taking that away is very serious.

To me that is not good to take some music or book to be  removed becuase that is not cool to do that becuase people read or sing what they feel most of the time. That is what people mose do they rend or sing what they feel about in waht they feel in there body that is what  I thing that they should  not removed they music or book, movies. You are going to remove people tallens I do thing that is ok to do that to those people they work haren to do wan they like in just be the thing they say or dowen you are go to remove there tallen no. The people that do like that than do lessn to it or see just shanjet to something more than that. You know that is bad to remove there musics and books because you wall remove there carenos to not just @NUM1 thing you will remove more than what you thing. You just make gtham lusen averthing to that is wan they like or love to sing or dowe there books of wan they think that is more than at book or song to them.      I say no becuase that is what they like to do in if you do like it than just do hare just shanjet than instad of makeing a big delown to them in make there life mesoper by harening poeple takeing of them of wan they sing or rending

Turn @CAPS1     @CAPS2 I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down. I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 be offensive to a single person, or group of people.      Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, @CAPS2 I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive.           Also, there are many people that find The @CAPS3 offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature.     Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs.          As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture. That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!
<START>

Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2

Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just @MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. Reading these things also amusses them. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies @MONTH1 be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it.     Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. Some books are writen in times of racisim. This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine.     Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just would'nt be fare. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others @MONTH1 enjoy them.

When you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence. Your not thinking when you send your kids their that there's going to be bad things. Most people go the the library to study or use the computers... But what about the other people?     I went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people. Some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again.     Another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out. But when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books.     The last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard. Most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem. Personially I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business.     You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. I believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back.      My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @CAPS1's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity. The up side to doing that is the library would get mor customers and that means the government would make more money

Does The Book @CAPS1 @CAPS2?                                                               @CAPS2's alot of books out @CAPS2 that I would love to take off the shelve's but the one book I would to take off the shelve's would be 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4'. While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In @CAPS7, I think @CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries.

I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then I think it isn't okay.     First, reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. @MONTH1 not be suitable for most young children. They @MONTH1 use profanity, show naked pictures, or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults @MONTH1 use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.     Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child does not be experienced to what could happened if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies. So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permenantly.      In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways. But, the books, movies, music, or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be move to a certain area in the library
<START>

Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson. Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive but some are. Those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book into action. Other children could show the book to other peers. And also, children can get very offended. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs?         Children nowadays are being motivated alot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. On the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action. Then the student could be in trouble. And people really wouldn't want that.          Children have a tendency of showing off to friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers. Just because children think it's cool. Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. The school can have a bad image from the students. Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that.           School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school. Within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. Children can be easily hurt. If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.               So why have offensive books in shelfs? These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. So yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.
<START>

Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  should be removed from the shelves if thery are found offensive. The reason why I think some things shuld be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with there children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries they really dont have bad things they only have school approte things. But the public library has alot of different things and than a school library. Therefore those are my reaons why i believe certain materials should be removed.
<START>

Censorship     In everyday life we see stuff that we think is appropriate and should be romoved but do we have the right to be able to get that certain item off the shelfs to stop the sppread of this certain item, and is it safe for the future of kids not to see this kind of material in stores, librarys and book stores.     Most cartoons have violence in them, matter of a fact almost all them do, every conflict is resulted to violence over a certain thing, kids sit down to watch these and not understand that there is violence in them, and understand that it is wrong not to be violent like they see on tv, some shows, movies are not right for kids.     Same with books, now days kids get into newer books based off of movies, like twilight, these book series have violence in them and if parents had to censor what their kids could or could not read, most of these books would be off the shelf and won't be able to be viewed by anyone mostly kids.     In newspapers there are violence shown, reported, or even been told, as a fact of kids safty if they saw it they would want to go and see if it still going on and to see it, kid safty is a high priority because we care about the future of them, on what they read, view, or even hear from books, tv, movies, and in newspapers.     All these reasons are good enough to give parents some censorship on what their kids read, hear, and view on a daily bases, even if cartoons show violence, kids can watch them and enjoy them, but not act the violence shown in the cartoons and be saying some of the bad stuff it says in them.

Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just @CAPS4 some people find @CAPS5 offensive. There's offensive material everywhere. Just because you find @CAPS5 offensive doesn't mean someone else does. In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at @CAPS5 or read @CAPS5.     A few months ago I was at the library. I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write. I over heard two girls talking. They were arguing about something. I moved closer to them so I could hear. '@CAPS1's this one about?' The girl asked. 'That's a really good book! @CAPS5's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives. @CAPS5 goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after @CAPS6's gone.' The other girl said. 'So you're saying @CAPS5's about sex?' The first girl asked. '@CAPS2, but only slightly.' The other girl answered. 'I'm not going to read this!' The first girl said. '@CAPS3 why not?' The second girl asked, confused. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this.' The first girl answered, '@CAPS5 sends the wrong message.' @CAPS6 added. After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about. I started reading @CAPS5. Intresting. Actually, @CAPS5 was a very good book. The second girl was right. @CAPS5 wasn't mainly about sex. @CAPS5 was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and @CAPS1 the man went through after his love died.     That got me thinking. Should certain reading material be removed because @CAPS5 talks about sex, drugs, murders, ect or @CAPS4 someone finds @CAPS5 offensive? No, @CAPS5 shouldn't. There's offensive material in real life and @CAPS5's not being removed. Why should @CAPS5 be removed from a library? @CAPS1's @CAPS5 matter if @CAPS5's in a book? There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just how life is.

Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy

If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same. I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way.     One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things. People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer.     If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents. Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong. Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit.     Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs. In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good. If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left.

If a people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and exetra then they will if they feel it is offensive to others. I wish they would not ,but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so. They feel that if someone can find some kind of offensive thing then they will feel it is okay to say or do thoughs things that they read or hear. It also commine sence to not do thoughs things that people wrote about. The auther's wright things to intertane and to egicate us about things that where okay in the time peroid that the story in this case was okay back then.     Most people these day take things way to serous now mostly because we have things like lawsuits and dercrimation. If someone can find something to complane about they will do so. if there is a book out there that is about back in the day when @CAPS1's had slave's and if there calling them a name that is not very nice. Then someone and complain and say that it is rashal and there will be a disbute about it and the auther will most likely loose and have to change that word into something els. People do not relise how much this happens it happens a lot expeshally with books.      Movies are a whole different thing now the things that happen on the movies get away with it mostly because they have money to get away with. There is a reason why things are @CAPS9 @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, and @CAPS4. @CAPS2 is for children under the age @NUM1. There are serten things that can be in though's movies. @CAPS2 @NUM1 there can be a lot more things it can be scarry to an extent and there also sometimes sexual things ,but they do not show the whole thing. There also can be villons and some swaring not a lot though. @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that's a whole new level they can have anything they really want and its a little more than @CAPS2 @NUM1 they kind of have a little more graphic than @CAPS2 @NUM1. Sometimes they have to choose between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @CAPS9 @CAPS4 it depends on how graphic things are.     Music is a whole other thing depending on what kind of music you are lissening to like theres @CAPS11, @CAPS4 & @CAPS13, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS17, and exedra. with all thoughs they talk about sex and volints. Now all of them excepent contry talk about drugs and @ORGANIZATION1 talks about @ORGANIZATION1. There are some that talks about more things, but most of them thats what they talk about. If perents do not want there childeren lissening to it then they do not lissen. there are ways of still lissening to it. most radio stations they can not swre on the radio, but they just cut it out. there are ways to have the uncut version, but thats on a @CAPS18, @CAPS19, or @CAPS20 @NUM7 player. There are ways to get around it.     See i think that it is dumb to take things like that away mostly, because they are going to see or hear about it someday anyways expeshally when they are in high school. Most teens do things with out there parents knowing and when they start driving they can lissen to whatever they want. Also they can read anything they want too, because they can buy the book and read it and hid it. Face it kids even younger find ways to do things that their parents do not want them to do. Matter what age they are they find ways to do what they want if they want it bad enoff. I think if a school wants to read something than they should have to have parents exent about it and if the kids can not read it than they can do something els insted or read something els. Do not take thing off the shelve just, because a couple of students can read or watch it. Your spoilling it for the kids that want to and can it is really unfair to the rest of the students they can not hepl it that there parents wont let them. If the parents won't then try to talk to them and tell them about it help them understand. Also people should have to watch what they do just because theres a kid the parent should leave them with a babysiter or something.

Books That Are Offensive     @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.     The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.     When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.     If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.       Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.     Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.     I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf.
<START>

The belief of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. In the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material.      One example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'. These type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in.      Another example on whether or not inappropraite material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse.     Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation.Therefore whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at

Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives. Things with heavy violence, gore, language and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as; personal influence, emotional growth and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye.     Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally, maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that conviced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines or music. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent.     These are even known to affect someone's emotions. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. But it is true the opposite way as well. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie @MONTH1 leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gorey scenes. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song and story alike. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away.     Children are easily affected in behavior, maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child @MONTH1 then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents. It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate.     So yes, certain materials should be taken away from the public eye, for the safety of the community and for its' children. Books, movies, music, magazines - We've all seen/read/listened to them, but what have they influenced on you? Have you become a better person for doing so? Or a worse one? Or maybe you weren't affected at all? We need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world. Keeping the bad things away from our children and from anyone who can be influenced in a negative way is a top priority for any one person, group or business.
<START>

Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated

Well to begin my Persuasive @CAPS1. THATS @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! How could they!? Dont we have a say in this?.... Well.... WE SHOULD!!!!        This is a little bit about what i think of this letter. I think that if books, movies, music, magazines,or anything else is offensive, then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right, and its @CAPS2 cuel, and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them. In my experenice, I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me. It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old. My parents and I where there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there, and came across a book called' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 ' And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the reglion I was raised in, and they @CAPS2 talked about there feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the @CAPS6-I-@CAPS6-@CAPS8-@CAPS9. And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about. And if you read that book, it made my question everything i belived.      So to rap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like i said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple. All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter, and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too.

Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by the bell rang it was time to go. When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian.      On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs. And moving the to the back closet.     About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way.

Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.

Do I believe that ceertain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book.           It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book.     So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's. Thanks for the conversation. See you next

Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population.     People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe.      The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal.     I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well.     We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!

Dear Newspaper;     In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.          If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else.

Why censor things? When there's always going to be someone out there wanting to read a book or magizine that others think should be censored. If this visious circle would continue then we wouldn't have any books left at all to read.     Theres lots of things out there that some people dont like but that doesn't give them the right to take it off the self. Then by doing that and taking it off the self just because they didnt think it was an apropriate book. Will leave someone with nothing to read now.     If the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things. Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines doesn't make them inaproprieate. It needs to be labled on the book that it has it in there. If you see the mark and you dont want to look at it then you dont have too.     We need to code books for different ages. Then parents could be happy if there little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are. Then if parents give permission then children could read books that were ment for older kids or adults.     Even though im not the biggest fan of reading but i will sometimes pick up a book that has things for me to learn in it about an engine. I dont think that people should be able to restrict anything and take it off the selves everyone has there own right to read the book or watch the movie, etc. But children are different because they dont need to learn all those things at an early age. So parents can pick what they can read. but if your an adult you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want to.

There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also.     The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad? Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to. That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis.

I believe that some materials should not be on the selfs, but not removed.They should have a room with everything that someone could offened anyone.Some books; music, movies, magazines,and etc. should not be totally removed from a public library.     I have seen a little kid pull a adult book of the self.The mother got very mad at the library for having it so low, on the self.I can understand some books being in the library.They should have all the adult book and etc. on the higher selfs so the little kids can not reach them.The library should have a room for only kids, and teenagers books; magazines, music, movies and etc. The kids should not be aloud in parts of the library that are to vilont , or sexual.The library should also have a room for all the adult movies and books with a locked door,along with the kid room.If the library does not have enough money for the rooms, they can atleast put all of the adult stuff on a top self or higher self.     I believe that some materials should not be on the shelfs,but not removed from the library.Because, someone might need that book to research something for school or a job.It could also take someones history out of the library if it is removed.I mean there is a reason the book; movie, magazine, music,or etc. was made.There is a reason that the material is there.Also the parents can help the library, by keeping a closer eye on their kids.Watch what the grab off the self.The parent can even have a friend or neighbor watch the children while the parent goes to the library so the kids wont see anything the shouldn't.     I believe everything i have wrote here is the truth about the way things should be in a public library.The adult stuff should be higher up.If a parent doesnt like it they can leave their kid at home,or not go to that library anymore.

There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. People all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects. Some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc. Another person @MONTH1 not and think its offencive at all. For example, a religous book that talks about @CAPS1 being one guy when some people beleive differently. The book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs.          The variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge. There should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in Katherine Paterson quote, its makin the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could. Which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem. People would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options. The library provides information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby. If that was takin away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world.         In @CAPS2 freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. Therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, @CAPS2 would not let this happen. People have the right to like whatever they want, if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should walk away from it and not stress about removing it

It dose not really mater to me, we all have the wright to are one likes and dislikes. Someone @MONTH1 not think that movies with blood in thim should alowed, but other @MONTH1 thimk that movie with adalt content should not not be alowed. If you dont like something and someone eles dose why should you get what you want and not what someone eles want. So if we tacke one movie, book, magazine, type of song or music off the market why dont we just all of thim off the market. Then there will be no arument about what is soutibal to watch and what is not. So if you dont like somthing or have littal kids and dont want thim to watch something or read somthing or look at somthing then just bont bay thim and if you do make sore it were they cant reach or fine or get to

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching: seeing: or hearing them. Vielence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight. We already have a high teen vielence rate. Our teen vielence rate really needs to be lowered. When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves.      The movies in my oppion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight. They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out. Movies are a bad influnes on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing. Movies could also get kids to be bullies. When a kid is a bullie they don't really know what they are getting themselves into. Another bad example would be drugs and alchoale. Teens and other children get put into peer prushior. When teens and other children have peer prushior its hard to say NO.      The kinds of music people listen to. Music could also be a bad influence on kids. The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alchoale. When kids get involved in drugs and alchoale that will mess up their whole life. For example the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone.      Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading. Magazines have bad imangs in them and when teens see the imangs they want to act and or be just like the people that are in them pictures.      Books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the vielence. There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer prushior. That is why im persuativing you to take the books off the shelves

How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 ctizens @MONTH1 take what these items say more offensivley than what it @MONTH1 seem.  They @MONTH1 seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true?          Due to all the diffrent races @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we @MONTH1 @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society.  I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc.  Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way.  Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or @CAPS2 they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should @CAPS2 be removed from there distribution around the world.       I know that wheather or @CAPS2 that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it.  I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc.  It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much.  It @MONTH1 seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through @MONTH1 just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all.  I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races.  These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere!  These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround.       When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on.  I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people.  I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround.  The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people.     Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better.  Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music @MONTH1 seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world

Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves? Some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves? I personally don't think the books should be removed. Some people @MONTH1 think the books do need to be removed some don't. What is your choice to this difficult question?     First off as I said before I don't think the books should be removed; but some people @MONTH1 not like my opinion. These books should not be removed just because they are offensive to other people. If another finds any book offensive that person should just ignore the book, not asked for it to be taken off the shelf; someone else might want to read that same book but if it is taken off the shelf then that person can't read the book. It isn't fair to take books off the shelf just because someone finds the book offensive. Any person that finds a book offensive should just ignore it and not read the book. That book that is offensive to someone isn't directed to he or she; the authors opinion shouldn't matter.                                     Second, everyones opinion is different. Some people want the books off the shelves some people don't. So who gets their way in this little arguement? I think the books should stay on the shelves. One person @MONTH1 find the book offensive and the next person @MONTH1 not. Other people @MONTH1 not even read the offensive book. But no matter if the book is read or not it shouldn't be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to all the other people who actually do want to read that book.                            Lastly, everyone enjoys different book themes. If you don't like the theme of the book then why are you reading it? If you don't like the book or you find it offensive go choose another book. Don't make it to where other people can't read the book if they like those kind of themes. You wouldn't like it if that happened to you. No one would like that. Just pick a book that has a theme you like.                                                  So as you can see I don't think it is fair that books get taken off the shelf if people find the book offensive. Some people @MONTH1 like that theme of the book or the story it has to it. Some people have different opinions of the book or it means something different to them. And just because someone finds a book offensive doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelf; it just isn't fair to other people.

Have you ever read a book you thought was offense? Have you ever read a book you didn't want any one else to read? I agree with katherine paterson if we can take one book off the shelfs we can take all the books of the shelf.      Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor.  Which  means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy.       Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them. The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them.     As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books.  Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them, but some poeple like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it. does that seem fair??     Now does some of those books seem a little better now?  Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy  reading those novels. This is why i agree with Katherine @PERSON1

Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them

In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.      A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them. Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose @NUM1 years of americas past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past.     The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries.      Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future
<START>

Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library

Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose.  This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's.  Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read.     Censorship of books is competely unneccessary.  If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to.  Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it.  Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book.  Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose.     Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence.  So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not?  Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf.  There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.     Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already.  Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch.  The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects.  By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films.  It is simply not thier responsibility.     Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content.  Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate.     Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'.  As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's.     Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians.  Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise.

Dear Newspaper,     I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie.      There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to.     Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns.     One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point.     In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea. One because of freedom of speech. Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. Third is its taking away authors money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory.

I dont think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do. I think that if people dont want there children to see it then dont let them.     I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all. I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago. I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take  it the wrong way.     I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right. There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, and ect. that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is. Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down? No!     Some people homeschool their kids for that reason ,but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do? I dont think so, there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to.     There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something. People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway. It is just hoe our economy is these days.

In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private. If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the @CAPS2 of to '@CAPS1' other people from it. In modern writing @DATE1 and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the @LOCATION1?     No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience. But that it is why these books are created for older people to read.      I am a large fan of books over the two @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like @DATE1 if the outcomes of those @CAPS3 would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these @CAPS3 can become something in the past and nothing more.     There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These bookos can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading.     Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now.     Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong. Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge.

I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves. If the materials propose things like racism, I would like those items taken off the shelves. Sometimes politics have a say in this. This is my say on this topic.     First off, people have an option of looking at those things on the shelves or on the internet. All of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive. Lots of people have families and kids and they don't want their kids to have to see that kind of stuff. The parents have the knowlegde of where most of the materials in libraries are. Also if the parents want to get books, why not go to a different library and get books. Or go to a store that sells books and is a little more censored. I only have one execption though, if the materials in the book, music, movie, magazine is racist in anyway, I would want that removed from the shelf.     Many people have the choice of wheather or not to go to a place that has offensive materials. Sometimes the local, state or even the federal government have a say in wheather or not this kind of material gets put on the shelves of libraries or on the internet. Who knows, maybe someone likes these kinds of books, music, magazines, movies etc., and they don't want them takin off the the shelves or off the internet. Even going on the computer and 'surfing the web' for stuff like that is a little bit crazy, but thats their choice. So thats my view on the censorship in libraries.

Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ? YES! Children shouldnt be exposed to certain things. Some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages. Children should read books that meet their age group. If children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way. Parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them. Children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them.          Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are to explict for kids these days. I think they should all be blocked and out of children reach. If children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act. Children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them. If kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today!     I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids. Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @MONTH1 appear offense. It will mean that they'll doing their job as a good parent.      Sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them. Parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because, sometimes kids would run over you. I know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness! Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this.     In conclusion explict magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. It might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them

If i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place. Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education.     Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out. One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways.     The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it. In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children.     Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive. I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history.     Books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. Removing this items would just be a total chaos. They should leave the libraries just the way they are. Everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want.

Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material

Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possiblities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect.       Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is @CAPS1 narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do @CAPS1 think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there.     Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do @CAPS1 need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do @CAPS1 think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could @CAPS1 find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is @CAPS1 good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can @CAPS1 stumble upon it, is the best choice.     Another reason that I believe that the books should @CAPS1 be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do @CAPS1 want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will @CAPS1 come across it. This is why the books should @CAPS1 be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section.     In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to @CAPS1 remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or @CAPS1 to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone.

No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want. One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want.     People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library.     This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. ''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to. if others find it offensive, then don't reed it. Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to. If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right.     One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were.      This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create.

In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a diffitcult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be remove from the shevles if they are found offensive by someone.           Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes arcoss a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems to be harse about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to comitdate everyone.      Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it.      Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, @LOCATION1, say that everyone has the right to free speech. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 has banned books thats are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries.      There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a  book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes.      The libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a diffitcult topic to agured on
<START>

No, I dont think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless,to some people @MONTH1 find everything offensive and others @MONTH1 not find it offensive like me personally stuff people find offinsive I find it kind of humorous.       And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that there should be no censorship it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policys it makes some people wanna go there less to get what they want and who knows the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored.  And I understand that when you have a kid you dont want them to fo the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible.  But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens.  From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view.     Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so that seems like a suitable age for early privelages.  When it comes to taking items off a shelf some peole have worse judgement than other people and that can effect everyone from their bad judgement.

Imagine. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This i could not imagine.     At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decsion. Kids should be able to read what they want to read.     As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies? I do not think so.     Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years. My cousins however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2.     So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books; what books would be left to read
<START>

There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed.      Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place.     I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No.     Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally.      You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look.     Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad.       These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life
<START>

I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything

The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive?  In my opinion I dont think they should censor the material.  Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us.     I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything.  People need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @DATE1.  Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there.  For example, some @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a @NUM1 @DATE1 @DATE1.   Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass.      We need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places.  Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future.  Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries.  Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons?       My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone.  I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I dont try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it.  Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes.

In my opinion, I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic. The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read!         I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it. but in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read. I hope understand through my point of view     All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library

There are so many resaons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it find something else.     If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person. Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it. If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it.     There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'. They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad. Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it.      It all comes down to common sence. We all have it we just need to start using it. That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads. If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine.

History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know

I think censorship  should be allowed and the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read.I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of hte dislike.Many people think by looking a diffrent types of  materials can have you look for the right imformation.I feel that if you limit the books and libraries that whould be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve.Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wonted is not there and the local libraries. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they wont and need.Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed

Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves.     First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong.      Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong.     Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone.We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this.     All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them

In this article I am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books. I am going to hit points on what I think about the subject. But also give what point of view I feel about the books that are on these shelves. Also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-sensoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf.     I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. But it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. But some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book. But you just can not for get about those books, you have to watch what they are reading.     Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read. You just can't do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. This I think can help with the problem.     I feel that they could also pre-sensor these books. This will help explain things in a way they can understand it. Plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. But also they print two copies one for a more mature audiance and one for a younger one. If they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information lke a mature person does and say this is not real life.     In @CAPS1 conclusion I feel like I am nuatral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library. But I feell it can be prevented in the way libraries run it. Just keep a closer eye the younger audiance. Also to try and pre-sensor them to make them more friendly to the younger audiance

Censorship in Libraries     The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment. They's a large variety of enterianment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet they're are some that have unappropriate things. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things.      Our children are the most important things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropitate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library.      If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves.      The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money. Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra. If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly. They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price.     The library is a very important part to one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad

Certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature. The music will always have ratings, just like movies. They dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice.      Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels.      If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups

Keep or Remove?      Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms.  And although these books @MONTH1 contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have shaped the @CAPS1 culture today.  Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material.  Just because some of these materials @MONTH1 contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy.       So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries?  Absolutely not.  Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature.  In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials is what @CAPS1 culture is all about.  People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street.  They want to read about what's going on in @LOCATION1 and about the hottest trends for seasons.  All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the amount of customers they attract.       Artists write about what they love and how they feel.  How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive?  That is what he or she chose to write about!  That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing!  By 'frowning upon' books, magazines or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors.  If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book, but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song.  By removing offensive books, songs and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginitive writing.       All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves.  Generations @MONTH1 never even hear of 'The @CAPS2 of @PERSON1' just because it uses racial terms.  So what would you do if put in this situation?  Keep or remove?

In this persuation essay it will talk about the content of should we or shouldn't we remove all offensive books, music, movies, magazines of the shelf. In this essay everyone will agree with the content or be in the opposing side of the aurgument. In this essay it isn't the exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience; however, there are situations in which the audience can go with both sides.      To begin with, in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive books,music, magazines, or movies from the library. I don't believe that all content should be remove for all to see. In some cases there are the exception, but in banding all material doesn't seem logic. In my point of view the removal of materials seems a little extreme; however putting the content in a higher shelf seems more pratical instead of removal all for good. Yes, it might be offensive but in this time period offensive movies, books, magazines, books, and so on are look as more comedial and not taken serious. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining. This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still see it. In this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing. It's not the creator of the content to be banned, yet it is the job as a parent to be mindful in what their kids are reading, watching, looking, or listening not them. In which case there there isn't away to be right in this subject. However the creators of the conent see it as a way to vent over their lifes, experiences, and what opticals they had to faceor just to make people laugh. They see it as a safe way to espress themselves. It might be offensive to you, but for some people that's there life. You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that's real life.      Secondly there are always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it doesn't seem logical to banned it. An example might be religion. A religion a person might be it might offend you. It doesn't mean if the religion offensive that it will get banned or be remove for everyone. Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differnces. If your friends has a different religion it doesn't mean you will never talk to them ever again.      Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that won't agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in a way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. A disagrrement between two girls fighting over which charater is better for @CAPS4. There are always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might be tried of hearing about @CAPS5 all of time and might find offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1. Saying why can't boys be like them, but even then they don't remove @CAPS3 all together. For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe.      Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) where a women that had nothing to begin with, yet ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people @MONTH1 seem that it might be cool to be just like her. It doesn't seem that people will go uot there and do what she does cause in the television show shows all of the consequences there are if you do what she did. This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her. Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can pervent a person to do something that they @MONTH1 later regreat.     In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It doesn't matter what it is we deal with it and our life goes on. There is no way to see this, but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others. It wouldn't seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So I belive that the libaries censorship isn't at risk. In my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to. And also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it

My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see

Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored.     Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive.      Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society

Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library

I belive that everyone has there own appioin on whats appropreate, and whats not. You can't @CAPS4 taske a couple people and ask there oppinon because everyone is differant, we all have our owne rights to know books and what the aurthor realy wanted us to learn or here about. Like i said everyone is differant if you @CAPS6't want your @CAPS1 to read it tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it to them. @CAPS6't make the rest of the @CAPS1 suffer.         I belive some parents need to look at our ansatre there wernt even aloud to have dreams and thoughts. Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go threw the same thing they had to, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 everyone shopuld have a right to look to read listen to what ever makes them happy, So what if i has volger launguage in it get over it or @CAPS6't listen to it all.            Would you want someone telling you that your life story for example was crummy and diddent like the way you worded things. Thats the way you talk it's because it's your life story. The way i see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also infor them of the good stuff in life so there won't allways be in fear. Let the chinlden read what ever they want to read. So what they curse tell your @CAPS1 that its bad launguage. @CAPS6't get ride of good books movies music.(@CAPS3:) @CAPS4 because the Author has a diff veiw on life than yours. Open your @CAPS5, @CAPS6't be so shallow

If you are sitting in the librarie and you are minding your doing your homework and studing for a test next hour, I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with.Would you? Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't. I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie.      There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive. Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered. There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them. But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy.     You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying I like to listen to music. It helps me think what I am going and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud. Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf.      Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people. If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad

I disagree that certain material, books,movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book. A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate, they should have identification to show that they are of age. The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books, movies, music,etc. for them for many reasons.     Ther should be nothing inappropiate in a library that a child can get a hold of. A child should only have things appropiate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things they child hear, see, or read. There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out. This is where th problem begin.     All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music. that why movies are rated, so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching. A parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see.     I think that things inappropiate should stay on shelves, but I also think it shoud stay in the adult section of the library. Childeren should not be able to go in the section for the adults. The inappropiate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases. There are some material that a  adult @MONTH1 need to help in life.     In conclusion, childeren should not be able to get a hold of  inappropiate material in a library, all libraries should identify someone the inappropiate material,and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries

If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inapropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it.     If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it.      My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inapropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about.      Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creaters worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.      In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and harkwork. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world. They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.

Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines.      I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child.     Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as a individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it.     Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away. Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason.

Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials. If everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time. There are many things people see, hear, and read about that @MONTH1 be offensive. Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things @MONTH1 just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention.               When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday @MONTH1 have at least one moment that's says something offensive. In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about @CAPS1-@CAPS2. I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating. So when it really comes down too it I am goin to be watching the same show again the next night.      What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone esle said about them. Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so '@CAPS3' today. I probably wouldn't be able too take this test that im doing right now. So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of  humor.     If we removed everything that was offensive today. Some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves. There are all kinds of different genre of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words.     My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones @MONTH1 break your bones but words only make you'. So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously

Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help soicity.Here are some ways how.      All books are diffrent. Some @MONTH1 have offencive language. If books have offenceive language you dont have to read it outloud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened.     Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender. If books are sexual for your age group then I would recomend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it. It could always be much worse than what it is.     Music music needs to be some cencorship on that. When your listening to the radio or a cd or ipod. You cant always censor that. the radio compianies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think its cool to use vulgor language.      Movies have diffrent ratings for diffrent age group. I'm sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. so censorship woukd really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about.           Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them.There should be some censorship in there because it is a persons life who there talking garbage.      Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same.      Things do need a little censorship. If we didnt have that its hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do.I know that when I was a little kid I would hear somthing on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents would'nt know what to do to me. I kjnow as an adult i would'nt want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age.
<START>

No i dont hink that should happen that would be stupid and im sure alot of people will disagree with it. one reason is because adults like all of that stuff.     And if they were doing this because kids keep geeting into them. then just get a door that says @NUM1 and older and put cameras up. If kids parents complain then at lest you can say that its all in one room and no kids aloud.     this shoudnt be a big deal if your a kid you are going to have to be round all the time when you grow up. So you might as well get used to it. it is a big deal if your cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff. when i was growing up i was around all that stuff and i think i turned out allright
<START>

Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books. music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble. The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.     Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand.     Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.     Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy. Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career.     There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.                                                                 Sincerly,                                                            @ORGANIZATION1
<START>

Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place.     In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age. You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me.     In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please.     Magazines are a different subject. Alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases.      In the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth.
<START>

People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can.

Does censorship really helf or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective.     Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen?     Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it?     Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.      All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other

In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where
<START>

I think everything should be there.  The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service.  For the magazines there should be all cars, trucks, atvs, mtvs, utvs, espn, golf, game informers, and wwe magazines.          Now for the books.  All the types of of books that should be allowed are @CAPS2-@CAPS3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 books.  And last the @CAPS1 service.  The @CAPS1 service sould be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use youtube on any computer.     This all should be used there because certin things some kids  don't have at home.

'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it.      This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it.      There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.      Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion. Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion!
<START>

I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.

Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored.     A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public.         Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our @LOCATION1, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them.     The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the @ORGANIZATION1 series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read.     Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happpened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored.     I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all

They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
<START>

I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.      So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.      I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.      The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.
<START>

I think that everyone has different views on different things so I dont think that they should be because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech.  If you disagree with the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it.  People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions.     People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them.  There several billion people in the @LOCATION1 and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when the get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library.  For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls @MONTH1 not like scary movies and @MONTH1 like movies with droma or somthing in that line.  Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf.       Yes, there are movies that I dont like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I dont stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I dont beleive in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it.  I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen.  I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not affend anyone.     I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts.  People like this you can argue with and you will never win the arguement and you can never get them to understand how you look at it. They just think think my way is the right way and the only way.       This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they dont not agree with.  I just think that evryone should try to undersatnd what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you.  I feel this way but I am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind.

I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it. Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.          Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same.     If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest. If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive.     Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.     Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something. But what you dont like someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust.

A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society

Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way.

In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative.  This is a very interesting quote.  She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it.  In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read.      Some movies can be way too provokative.  Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across.  Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it.  People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over.  When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children.  The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying.  To many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions.     Music is especially one to do this.  There are not a lot of  songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it.  Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon.  If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said.  Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to.  That is not a mothers dream to go and do that.     There are too many magazines that try and expose women.  They use this to try and see more magazines.  This is wrong to do.  A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong.  Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea.  When girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model.  They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs.  Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve.          Some parents let their kids get away with too much.  They should censor what their children do.  Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them.  Everyones point of view is different.  People @MONTH1 think that this scene is to provocative and another person @MONTH1 look at that and say there is nothing wrong.  It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation.  If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf

Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.

Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media.

How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others!     Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things!     Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know!     Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try!      The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!

I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive. The books and media help the human race sympathize with eachother and know about things that already happend so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again. Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happend in the past.Taking books off the shelfs of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you suceed in life.         some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it. some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't.

In todays world there are so meny movies and books that it's hard to watch or read all of them. They all have different look and ideas. Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different testes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so meny different types of ever thing becuse we do have different beliefes like relegen, class, and cultur.     Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it of the shelf becuse someone somewhere thought it was offersive we would not have music or any thing like that. I don't really have to meny thing that I get offened by but I do know that I have seen some showes that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny.     Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf becuse some people don't believe in it so meny things would change and releges are not going to be the same in any way.          That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offens to that. The way i put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or leasn to it. Every thing in all of these bisnisses is in taking a resk. Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc.       So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this. That is why we have our own free will and and make the choes that you want to good or bad, right or wroung. You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening

There are some certain materials i think is affensive to childrens is book,music,movies an even magazines.Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to @CAPS1 books and other unsafe materials.Another thing is music, and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them.Movies such as @CAPS1 movies some children @MONTH1 watch them and reflect wat they have watched on tv.The next thing is magazines,has material such as appropreate pictures in them tats why they should take the books,music,movies and magazines off the shelf.

How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.

Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way.      The word offensive is a contreversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.      So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person.

In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple

Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests

Many people, after reading a book, listening to a song, watching a movie or reading a magazine have found themselves upset or disturbed by that peice of media and feel that it should be removed from the shelf they found it on. I feel that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, that libraries and media centers should separate such materials from other books, magazines or @CAPS1.      My opinion is that not everyone will find the same things disturbing or offensive. It depends on that person's background, religion and personal beliefs. I do not that think books, magazines or @CAPS1 shoulds have to be banned from library shelves just because that particular person finds that peice of material offensive. If they find it so disturbing then they should discontinue reading that book or magazine, or listening to that @CAPS3.       One person should not be able to make the choice of keeping a certain book or magazine on the shelf because somewhere out there, I'm sure there is someone who does not find it offensive. The partial point of writing a book or song is to express one's opinion of a topic and if the reader or listener does not approve of their opinion, then they should respect that director or author's thoughts and move on. If a library or media center contains inapropriate books, magazines or moviees, they should create special areas or shelves to keep such material. This area could be created for adult or mature readers, viewers or listeners. I also think that books and other peices of media of such inapropriateness should have a label regarding its offensive or explicit content.     If someone finds a song, book, or magazine article offensive or disturbing; I do not think that a single person has the right to have it removed from the public and that there are other ways to keep such material out of a reader or listener's hand, that @MONTH1 not know about its possible offensiveness. If warning signs are shown, then the reader or listener should realize that they are taking the risk of being offended or disturbed. If such measures are taken, I think they will keep all readers, viewers and listeners pleased.

Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone.     I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people.      I do beleive, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwated material.      To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different veiws, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left

I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects. Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live.    What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess.     Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed.

I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occuring.     If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because @CAPS11 or she finds it offensive? Because @CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.      Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @PERSON3. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language. @CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @LOCATION1. The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story.     Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated @CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to @ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.     If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. @PERSON2 said, '@CAPS11 who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' @CAPS12 is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.     These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.      Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therfore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries

I think that libraries should not remove material such as book, music, movies, magazines. I think that libraries should keep them because thier are alot of people tht has thier own stlye at reading. Sometimes i will go to the librarie and get a book, then i will go look at magazines, movies, music. Thier are alot of movies out right now, and now u can go cheak them out. Music is the same way. I feel like if thier stuff in the librarie that kids like they should go for it. Im sure that they have edgucational books, movies and magazines.                                                                                  If  people take out stuff that kids and teens like. Some of them might not return back.Thier are alot of students that listen to music and watch movies too. I love cheaking out movies from the libraries its easy and they always have the movies that u are lookin for. The movies are easy to find. and its quick. If the music has some offfensive stuff in it that they should take it off the shelves because it will have peopel thinkin why would they put a movie, music, magazines and book up on the shelves if they know it is offensive to the public.                                                          Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people. The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more. I really hope the people make the right choice

Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies. While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded.     When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.     A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary. This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened.     In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library. In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness.     If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people. When voted one it could stay or be removed. Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well.

If I think that something is offensive then yes, it should be removed from the bookshelves. The library is a place for everyone and not just one type of people. If something offended you then u wouldnt want someone else of the same race, religion, or family to read it and be offended. Yes, we have freedom of speech and can say anything we want, but i think it should only go so far and then should be stopped.     Someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good. If somebody were to write about the blacks and saying they are all dumb just because they are black, then the blacks would notjust stand around and do nothing. After u call someone names or pick one them so much it scars them for life and it could hurt their whole communication skills for the rest of their life. Not everyone but some even take it so far as hurting themself or others.     So if i seen a book on the bookshelves of the public library that offended me then yes, i would want it to be removed so it doesnt offend anybody else. I dont think that hurting someones feelings is worth messing up their whole life or causing them to hurt themself.     If something hurt u or offended u would u just let it happen or would u use the rights that we are given and try to make it right and not hurt anyone else? Would you want somneone writing about u in a mean way? You would probly try to make it right. If you could fix something and didnt just because you didnt feel like it and it continued to offendother people then not only is it the persons fault that wrote it but i could see it kinda being your fault for letting that person still burt people.

Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material.      Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic.  Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life.      So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books,music,videos,video games,writing,or movies.      We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate.     So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide?      My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting.      So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words.          My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended.

I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should  have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.

In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads.     Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book.      Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not.      Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't.          There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like.

Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide. That some might not find it offensieve as others do. No because people have different beleafs than others.     I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive. But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do.     Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks. the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life.     No because people have different beleafs then others. In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library. So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers. Their business would fall.     The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money.  So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do. No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible

Dear editor,     I feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the self. I mean realy it will start confliced.Then we have law suight.     I have seen what happens when you take a book off the self. the people start yelling because they did not find it offending. Then they say that they are going to suw. Last it costs mouney to go to corght.     I have also seen what happens when u take music off the self. people yell at first. Then they start to get vilent. Know you have a mob of people destoyinh your store because you took down some music.     This is why we need to keep them all up. You can take this any way  that you want but i hope you learn before it is to late. I hope that you will put this in the peaper thank you.                                        Sinserily Your,                                             @PERSON1

I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves.  I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive.  I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them.  Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book.  Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading.     There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing.  People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence.  And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive.     If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well.  A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button.  Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.     Some people might enjoy material that is offensive.  If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted.  There would be alot of complaints, and problems.  And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited..     The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have.  Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy

The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.

Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.     Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragted by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media.     Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong?     In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.

Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others.     If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers.     Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction.

Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere, however, you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a   boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship.     Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through. This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life. Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands.      Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids. Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material
<START>

I don't think that certain materials should be removed if they're found offensive to people. If someone reads something and it offends them, they can go do something else. I'm not the type of person to get offended too easily, So I don't know how well my opinion fits. Everyone gets offended over something, so I can see why people find somethings offensive. But in all honesty, if someone read something and thought that it was offensive, they have the option to either say why they thought it was offensive, or they could just ignore it.      In libraries, I think that if the @CAPS1 finds a story offensive, it should be okay for them to take it off the shelves, They work there after all. If it were me though, I'd just let it go, and if someone asks me to remove it, I might do it. Alot of people now-a-days, seem to take offense over everything. But a material should not be removed from a library shelve, unless the @CAPS1, or the manager, find it offensive, then I can understand their decision.

Censorship on Libraries.     Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But,  if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are  uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.     When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years.      Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention?  You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way. Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.      What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.      Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be

It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire.     These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.     The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not.      In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression
<START>

Knowledge @CAPS1     @CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither @CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything @CAPS2 be offensive, and removed. Then libraries @CAPS2 cease to exist. What about in the court room? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials @CAPS2 leave people in a bored mindless state of mind.     Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the @LOCATION1, modern day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom.     Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy.     If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.'     So, if you want to have an un-@CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you. Do you want that to change? I know your awnser; it's a no

A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.

To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No why should it. Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.     For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too

There is much censorship that occurs in the world. Music on the radio, television shows, or the internet is all censored. In todays society the library is a forgotten wonder to most, making it a secluded world. The library is a place were one's mind can explore and discover as much as it wants. The library should not be a place of restricted discovery, like on the televsion or the internet, censorship in libraries should be non-existant. People learn from books; books with happy endings, and sad endings, and gruesome endings, are all able to provide lessons for the reader.     Many say that history repeats itself. Therefore history is taught in schools so that the bad events that occurred in history can be prevented. This is the same for the books that are on library shelves. When reading a book, the reader is able to experience the lifes of the characters as if they are living with the characters. Through the experiences of the characters, the reader gets to observe all the things done wrong and right by that character without acually living the experience. By the end of the book the reader will have knew views on life, and will try to not make the same mistakes as the characters in the book.      A major fear among the parents is the inappropriate language or scenes that @MONTH1 be described in books. To be blatantly honest, there is foul language and inappopriate doings in this world. It is much better to have it discovered gradually through reading and maybe a couple of life experiences, then to have it all thrown in ones face at one moment. The censoring that occurs on the radio and television is fine, just when someone wants to improve themselves by reading, they should be able to read whatever they feel.     A library is a place of wonderous learning, but if there is censorship, it restricts ones learning. Through reading one is able to experience life without the consequences of experienceing life. All books are able to be learned from, and they should all have the opportunity to be learned from.

Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want.

'Do you bleieve that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?'  No, I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does.  Everyone has a different opinion, we're all different.  We need variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc..  Censorship is understandable, in some ways.  Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice.       Your opinions, decisions, outlook on life yourself is one of a kind.  How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book?  Exactly, that doesn't make sense right?  If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment.  In my opinion; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc. then leave it alone.  It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion.  Be open minded!     Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt.  It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong.  Individuals should all have individuality.  Without variety, how is that possible? From music, books, magazines, movies, etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censory in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy. All books, music, movies, magiznes, etc.can be considered offensive to someone.      When it comes to books in the library we should have sections. One for @CAPS3, child, family, activity, romance, etc. if we have thoes then it would cut down on what books children can look at. One time I went to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 and I accidently wondered into the @CAPS3 books section. I knew that I was not suppost to go into that section, but if they had it marked that it was the @CAPS3 Books section then I would not have gone in there.     Parents need to moniter what there kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wonders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book it is not the librarys fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to moniter what the child looks at they could set boundries. they could say 'Do not leave this section.'. If my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books. The parents could moniter the child to solve the problem.     Library's need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book. If your public library does keep thoes books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other towns people about the rude books. If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will stand up aginst the books.     If you do not like what the library has on the shelfs, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve you public library? how are you going to make you kids not go and look at the books you dont want them to see

Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 just like in @DATE1'. You could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art.     The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to show to the reader. For example like in the book '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory. It shows many storys tying in with each other. When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the side of the cliff by @CAPS3 when he launches the huge rock over board. That shows the fall of man. In the @CAPS4 where @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said.     Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract that could kindle some controversy. Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarion. Who would give you the right to censor thier master pieces. For example @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demon's in his paintings and people might think that is way too graffic. People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time.     Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This would to a book called '@DATE1' by @PERSON1. In his book he show complete govnerment @ORGANIZATION1. We as the people of our goverment would be classified as the '@CAPS6'. The @CAPS6 made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also could not think for themselves because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything you could think of. The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the @ORGANIZATION1. They knew that @CAPS6 could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have not personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now.      Censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading too, not a single artist could display their art. Aslo censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This could not work in our society today. So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of.

Bad @CAPS1      @CAPS2 off yes, I do think think they should be removed if they are bad. If you wouldn't say it to your parents face when your at a younger age then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it.     I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldnt say to my face. There are so many things that little kids can see. Like at any @LOCATION1 or any where there are magazines with ladies in there bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys. I dont think its right they should they them put up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see. Those kind of things are justy going to get kids asking question that make the parents have to lie.     Then theres kids watching tv and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are on there cusing and talking aboout sex then your kid goes to that channel when your not around hear all these stupid stuff. Then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it. When you can just take channels like that off your tv and make everything easier.      I think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that. I would never let my kids listen to music like that i don't care how old they are. I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are  from the music they want to listen to its horrible. I would do anything to make it where kids coudnt listen to that stuff until their parents didnt care. I know my parents didnt like me listening to it when I was young and I see why now that im older and know what all of it means so i'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age.     In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way. Why let are kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the longt run it just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want.

I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow. I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themself. If it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian.     Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age, and maturity. Regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else, such as the tv or the internet.     The public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on  education about somthing. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there. If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it.        If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not. Nudity, perfanity, violence, and provocative materialare in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of kepping it from children or people its apart of everyday livng.

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.
<START>

I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons @MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read.     I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge.     All offensive items a library @MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others.

All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and  hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf.Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex.      A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'. I was a good book but it was also very explesive. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug.      This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book.  I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media.      Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older

I am writing to the newspaper, about removing certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. I dont think this should be allowed. I dont think it would be far to others.     I'm going to give you three reasons why you shouldn't let people just remove stuff like that off of shelves. @CAPS1 first reason is that, what if you had a child and wanted he or she to see the same movie or book you did when you were little? But they took it off the shelves. That would be sad and you would want them to see the movie or book you did but they cant. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'     @CAPS1 seceond reason is, what if you and a wife or husband had a favorite song, but they took it off the shelves? That would be devistating, it would just break your heart. Well I know it would me if it was are wedding song.      The last reason and @CAPS1 favorite reason is, you just have your own opion. Everyone has thier own opion, if you dont want to see them or look at them just dont do it. It's as easy as that, just try to ignor it. It's really not your problem to worry about.     Those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves. Like what Katherine Paterson said 'But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 if we let this happen everyone will take avanege of it. That is why I am @CAPS2 no to letting people remove anything off of any shelves

Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 provides a very valid point. If we start taking off book that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity.     Books provide insight into the author's life. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1. During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the @LOCATION1. It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. @CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1.     If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain image. It also teaches us not to what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teaches us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair.     Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society.      Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occuring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunatley most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started?

Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many of years people would come to the libaray for them. some  @MONTH1 be volger as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive, but there should be a age check out law. as well as being with in consideration for this centerys ways.     There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw

Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything.     If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves. They might say no. If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best. Go ahead and listen you will be amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it.      I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now thats just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. @CAPS1 you think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have.      If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Lets go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 everytbing started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show.      If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said. @CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out educatiion and what not. You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't @CAPS1 I was little.      If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern. Even teens. Even though the don't want you too. Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, @CAPS1 you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better

When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole.     The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.     The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them.

Libraries are stocked filled of all kind of reading materials. Such as books, magazines, and catalogs, but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library? My answer is no, but should they be taken away from the librabires, no. Although many kids go through libraries so do many adults trying to find good pieces of litature, that is why they should keep these books available to most.     When i was in the seventh grade i recall reading a book, by the title of @PERSON2, about a child who had gotten sexually abused, i wish i had never picked up that book. Although it made me very frightened, it taught me a very good lesson. I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers, and if it wasn't for this novel it could have been very different. Therefore i believe it is good to get children at a young age small dosages of the real life, not every thing in the world is sugar coated like @PERSON3 would argue.     From @CAPS1 to the bible, there is a vast variety of litature. This variety provides stories for many audiences. The libraries try to do there best by catagorizing these books so that smaller children do not get there hands on the wrong books. Instead of taking the books totally out of the repitoure, another suggestion that could be made is to have a system like they do for mature rated video games and only allow people over the age of @NUM1 to check certain books out. This making it near impossible for children to get there hands on the wrong books.          Lastly, a suggestion that could be made is to label inappropriate books such as @CAPS2.Ds and movies. This could make a small difference and make children think twice before opening up a book labelled for mature audiences only. This providing stories for all, and protecting small children from magazines such as @CAPS3.          Like Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I percieve what she is trying to say is similar to what i am. She wants all the books to be provided and kids just to be shyed away from these, and hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of litature from a library

I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just seperate the things in sections. That way there would be no problems.    I mean, why change something if only a few people doesn't like something? Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want, @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all. So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions.
<START>

Censorship, a very sensitive topic. @CAPS1 are so many things people dislike, so they censor @CAPS2, hiding the idea's from the people who don't know about @CAPS2. I personally detest censorship. I would rather the world be an educated place with minor dangers, then a place where everything is kept secret and safe.     You must be thinking, '@CAPS1 are some things we have to censor, @CAPS2 can harm our childrens minds.' But in truth, your children will find out about @CAPS2 in the real world eventually anyway.  In reality, drugs, alchohol, sex, rape, violence, and all the other things you censor are common things that your kids will hear about. Most children first hear about @CAPS2 in school, normally elementary, and if not they will definately find out in junior high. If they will eventually find out anyway, wouldn't @CAPS2 be better to let them find out the easy way?     Now you must be thinking, 'But if they find out too young, @CAPS2 could tramatize them.' That is a risk, but most teenagers are more tramatized anyway when exposed to @CAPS2 without any prior knowledge. If they already know what their dealing with they would know how to react, but if they have no knowledge of whats going on they could make a major mistake without even realizing @CAPS2. Once again, wouldn't @CAPS2 be better they find out from you or a book, then find out the hard way?     Now, you @MONTH1 be thinking, 'Our children must be protected, this knowledge could just put them in more danger.' @CAPS2 @MONTH1 put them in more danger, @CAPS2's always a possibility. The world is full of possibilities though, anything could happen. This knowledge that you always hide from them @MONTH1 be what they need to know later on, and wont know when they need @CAPS2. What would they do if they see their friends start doing drugs, and since they have never heard of drugs, they don't know @CAPS2's a bad thing to do? Or if they see older kids drinking, and are offered a drink, but dont know they shouldn't take @CAPS2? Or if they wind up kissing someone they like, and @CAPS2 goes too far, but they don't know what their doing?      Anything could happen, and your children need to be prepared. If they don't know of these things, they can't tell if what their doing is good or bad, and they @MONTH1 wind up getting in trouble or hurt. Tell them, or let them read the books you always censor at the libraries so that they know. Life is full of risks, so let them know, that way when the time comes their ready.
<START>

As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs. A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too.      Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how do this and that. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book. They see the cover that intrigue them. They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should.      Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow

Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor~~ then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' quote.Having the right to do something is a part of freedom of speech almost. Its believing in your decesion or choice you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same oppurtunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be unappropriate books in the library that we absolutly would not want our younger group of siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom an right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put a censorship on the libraries really?     I feel that censoring a library would not be nessarry considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries or organized from A to @CAPS1  in authors names, seperated from non fiction an fiction, cd's seperated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book seperated in diffrent sections. Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if theres plenty of  bad influces, peer presure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and @PERCENT1 in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books.     I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words. Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly @NUM1 but I could relate to alot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraies we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, confort and etc. We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right.

Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.

There is alot of different thing that can offensive to all sorts of  people . so if we started taking thing off tv or out of book ,and magazines we would be always takeing stuff out. if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area. would censorship be the awnser to take out  stuff no. we need to be more aware of where ur children are an there would be less probblem.     If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it

A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.

A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library.

Censorship          @CAPS1 was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was somthing you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it did you. Censorship is somewhat the same way.     The other day, my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't aloud to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends? Doesn't go so well does it. Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless your of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern day @CAPS2. Tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did @CAPS2 do with his idea, he failed miserably. How do you think the @CAPS4 victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody, they just wanted to live they're lives a diffent way.      Thats what censorships doing, classifying people in to certain groups. telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. Thats what makes the world different, people that are different. Dont't make everyone be the same.

Everyone has different views on works of literature, wheather it be books, magazines, movies, or music. If libraries were to removes this stuff from the shelves then they would be loosing business, they would be loosing children, and they would taking away the reason of it being on the shelves.      These libraries would be loosing business to the people who maybe like the kind of stuff that they @MONTH1 not. The people running the business @MONTH1 decide to take out older pieces of work that @MONTH1 offend younger people in this generation. The stuff wrote, sang, or played in these things @MONTH1 harm these people but that is not what it is in there for. The things that harm people are in there to show people in the younger generations how life was lived in the older days, as in the slaves.      This would play a roll on children that use this library also. If this literature was taken out, children @MONTH1 think that things have always been the way they are as they see it. If these children grew up and were to see a book, hear a song, or watch a movie about how things were in the olden days, and how much it has changed, then they @MONTH1 never believe it because they were not taught as children. As they are older, they @MONTH1 still never have the interest to learn about these types of things because they never knew about them growing up.      These things are wrote to teach people and children about how things used to be, they are not used to harm people. When people take these things harmful, they are not getting the true meaning that the author had in mind when the wrote them.      Libraries should keep these peices of literature on their shelves, only to teach young people of what the world has came from and how their older relatives lived, and what they came from

I feel that it should be censorship in libraries.Children shouldnt be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to.This could save people from getting in trouble and reading thye wrong stuff.     There should be censorship in libraries.I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.One other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching,you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @MONTH1 be.Thats why if we had censorship,they wouldnt have a chane to do so.Another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library.     As you can see,these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.They already have book stores and online site, where u can buy books and movies,and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.So with that being said,I feel there should be censorship in libraries.

The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.

I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that book uses the @CAPS4 word to describe african americans, but when that book was published that was common talk now people look at you like you have just murdered there first born child if youu were to use that word.      For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids.     I know that during @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 over in germany many books were banded because they had something to do with catholicism or something that @PERSON3 believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time alot of what @PERSON2 wrote was banned for using the @CAPS4 word but people have to realize that when @PERSON2 was alive that was everyday laungage.     As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned.     As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist.     I dont think that movies shouyld be banned form the libraries because of violence or anytning of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contians anything of the nature of pornagraphy but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway  so they are a step ahead of me.     I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's I do not get offended at a lot of things

The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know. My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves. People should have ther own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read. My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc..     I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie. This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.     In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person. This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine ,'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure' which I believe is a good saying for this topic

I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.

Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys.      I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.     Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there. Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it.     In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading. Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too.
<START>

Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it.     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like.
<START>

Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read

I believe everyone has the right to voice there own oppinion on life. If we censor ones books, music, or movies because they are inapropriate, it would be like silencing an oppinion that stands out among the others. If we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view?     In the @ORGANIZATION1 we have the freedom of speech and press. these amendments make it so that otheres can voice an oppinion with out being shot down. Although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish. Say we found a diary writen by @PERSON1? Are we aloud to view his deepest darkest thoughts? or Are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes. His ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? no we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life.     I believe that no matter whos ideas it is, if aloud by the author, should be aloud to be read and comprehend in our own way.     If one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @CAPS1 then i think they should be aloud to do so. The reason why; The @CAPS1 is becoming absolete, the technology era is officially here. There is not a thing we can't find in @CAPS1 that can't be found online.      Although the @CAPS1 is a government run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media. It is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @CAPS1 a child could find it. But like the internet you can block things from those kids.     All voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biest, or just insane. these are ways to view the persepective or the reason behind hate and war. if we can learn from other mind sets through books, music, movies and movies, then i think we should be aloud to.     Nothing should be blocked from the public. Every one has the right to voice there own oppinion through there own way.
<START>

KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF!     I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies. Yeah those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then dont get it, but someone else might like that book.      For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library.      A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back. keep the childrens books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavory, but there isn't any books on slavory because somebody thought it was offensive against african americans.      I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious belifs. like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something.     The movie situation i understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because i want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the libraries movie business would be over.      To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally i think that there should be a variety in the library. If not everybody would get bored of the same books. Over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF

Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?

I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. Its a library, a place where people go to get information.      If you dont want your kid, or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, untill they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books. I dont think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its to ghory or has to many curse words for your kid.          Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material. If you do then dont read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by.      This is what I think on the censorship on the book, movies, music, magazine, etc. Its a library, they are going to have a bunch of material. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch or listen to
<START>

In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear.         Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people. The words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence.      I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me.      In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them

Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture

I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make.     First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. @CAPS1 should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Everytime an item is removed off of a shelf, @CAPS1 will be an unsatisfied customer.     Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter.    Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what what readers' like, then no one else should involve theirself. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business.     In conclusion, I beleve it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people @MONTH1 disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. @CAPS1 defintly wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.

Newpaper company,@CAPS1 am writing to this company on why I think the certain books, music, movies and magazine should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive. @CAPS1 wirting to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince a argument. @CAPS1 reflecting my view on censorship in libraries. @CAPS1 writing so you can hear me out on what I have to say and persuasive you on this essay.     First, I think know book should be taking off on any shelf of any library. Rather if it was to do with people thoughts on religious, race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past. For example, gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic. I beileve that know one should disrespect anyone opinion on what they have to say. It depends on what kind of language your using for this type of subject if its has harsh words and its suppose to be harmful, then yes it should be remove. Another thing is children taken books off shelves. Maybe you should ascort your child in the child section and telling him or her what they should not do like taking stuff down that they are not suppose to. What I'm saying is if suppose to hurt other and is offensive using negatively words to harm others feelings, it should be remove.      My letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what I think should be in a library or not. I have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what I think is right or wrong in this situation. I hope my topics and argurment has convince you on if you should remove a book from a shelf.                                             @ORGANIZATION1

Are there universally evil books that no one should read? Are good and bad no longer matters of opinion for the readers themselves? The answer is no. Censorship is a terrible practice masquerading as a boon. The right to read certain books should not be left to a conservative few, because everyone has their own opinion about everything. There is always something we can potentially learn from books, and it's never right to take that away. Freedom of speech should certainly come into play here as well, allowing the authors' words to be heard without interference from those who would dictate what we read.     There is a reason libraries have many sections. They have to cater to the individual tastes of the masses, without regard to what other people find offensive. If one was to go through the library and burn every book they did not like, there would be scarcely anything left. Send in another person with different tastes, and then you have a completely empty library. It is far better to leave all the books alone so that everyone can find something to enjoy reading. Basically, there are bound to be people who have similar opinions to the author of just about anything, so allow the authors to share those opinions.     Then we have the knowledge portion of the issue. Offensive material to one person might be what another person wants or needs to read, whether for recreation or class. There is much to be learned in the way of psychology and human nature from almost any writing. Perhaps a restricted section would be in order if the problem would involve corruption of innocent minds, but a full censor would never be necessary.     Finally, there is an amendment in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 for preventing censorship. It is unconstitutional to restrict any form of expressive speech, whether it be books, movies, music, or magazines. And what is more restrictive to an author than to have their books banned? The greatest difference between our country and a totalitarian government is the simple freedom allowed in the @LOCATION1. If we start restricting that freedom, what are we then?     In short, censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used. People all have their own opinions, all media can be learned from, and our freedom should not be restricted. The practice of censorship is what should truly be banned from the shelves.

Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned. What makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world.      I think its safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say ect. But in other terms do we have full conrol of our kids @NUM1. I knw that this might sound wierd but I strongly believe in the simple fact hat kids are being over sheltered to day! Our kids are groing up with the new technology. Its the centry for computers and laptops and gaming systems. Our kids dont know what its like to go out side anymore. The world has so much to offer us yet, we turn it down beacuse we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. I think it is very important to be books smart as well as street smart, if you spend all your @CAPS3 doing one thing at at @CAPS3 you are gonna end up lacking on one thing. I blelieve grades will come.     I think that our kids are over sheletered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we dont want them to see, or there not ready for then there not allowed to see it it, but whos to say on the days your not watching them that there not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didnt want them too! This is why its important for you to teachyour child what is going on in the world and noth leave them in the dark.     Also we are living in the new age of life, were computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be usign and on throught the day. It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since ever thing is done over the internet now. It is a privilage to be so far advanced in the world yet we still dont know what to do!      As we get older we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as need to be known and taught beacuse as we get older were gettomg, more logic and more information over the materials on the web. Kids will not know how to fix cars or know to start up a lawm mower.      I think that books should not be taken off te shelf beacuse as the day goes by kids reality is getting taken and taken more and more! I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about the everyday life becuse that is our future and if they have no idea what is going on and it scares me beacuse the are going to be alot more battles for our kids to fight we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life !                                                 Thank You for Your @CAPS3!                                                            Deven

Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.

Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people @MONTH1 not realize it but they do. Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf.     Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it. Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting. If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. people can  be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books. I think moives would offend more than a book would.     In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this word way to easy. One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs

Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1.  While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not.     There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  However, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material.       In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands

Books can make a very deep impression on whoever reads them, and sometimes these impressions are not appropriate for the reader.  Books that are found inappropriate to children or even teenagers should be reconsidered to be removed off shelves that are exposed to children or teenagers. I think that children should not learn inappropriate material if they are not ready to learn about it, in other words if they are not age appropriate.  Books are just one thing, there are also movies, music, magazines, and etc.  All of these things can give wrong ideas to our children and teenagers.  Inappropriate media or imformation should not be exposed to people that are not ready, or mature enough to watch movies, or read books that could harm or give them wrong impressions.       Children that have read books or watched inappropriate media can sometimes change how they are like. I think that many children that watch movies especially that should not be exposed to them. Some of the movies that I have seen have been very inapropriate and I could not imagine young children watching these movies. This is because I do not think children know as much as we do, so it will give them wrong ideas they have taken the wrong way.  I think that books or media that is inappropriate can change childrens childhoods in a negative way.       Children and teenagers should also be mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, movies, and magazines.  If all the age groups would be exposed to all of the higher rated movies, books, and magazines I dont think that would be very resbonsible on the libraries part, or whoever was exposing it. I think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere.  Parents would also not appreciate if their children were reading, or seeing something that they think their child should not be exposed to.  I think that children are simply not mature enough to be exposed to all of the books, magazines, and movies.  It would cause a lot of problems for many people.       Many of the children would be doing stupid things that they have seen in a movie or read in a book that they thought was cool, or that they should try it.  Were are already having a problem with pre-teens or teengers. This is because many of them are exposed to things at a early age they should not see, that effect there actions.  There are many actions I have seen or heard of that relate to a book, or movie that probaly would not have happened if the person was not exposed to it.       Children simply are not ready, or mature enough to be exposed to everything that books, movies, or magazines have to offer.  It can change the way that children think, or what they think would be cool to physically do.  I think that it is bad enough that a lot of teenagers have been exposed to a lot of these things already.  This should be a wake up call for those who have children.   Books shold not be exposed to every age group, because it would hurt society and whoever is not ready to learn or witness what they will

Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.

There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion. When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment.

i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?

Dear Newspaper:              @CAPS1, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries just for censorship.          These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book. Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem. However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people.          I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies. I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries?
<START>

Now take a moment and go back to highschool. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1? Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occassional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong.     The @CAPS3 was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others?      Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic.     So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it

There are a bunch of very good book sat a public libary, you can get all kinds of different types of books. You are get a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do, I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out. Just because a book is an opion dont mean it needs to be taking off shelves. Everone looks at everything differently.     If you read it can help you in many different ways, you can learn alot just from reading a book. Me personally i hate reading, so i dont learn much. I'm more of a hands on type of person, words just fly through one ear and out the other really. It is really have to understand when im trying to read and listen or write an listen i lose my thoughts to easily

My say would be no. becuse all that was history, say you hade like a kkk thing or anything like that. say you had a wighting aport but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes,dates and other thing

I do belive in censorship, but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal. It should the parants job to block materials that they think is bad for their kids. If it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it.                  My point of view in stoping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not ment to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a yonger age unless they get the ok from their parents.     The views of censorship in my mind is that if someone see something they don't like they want to get rid of it and if is something to wrong then yes it should be censor, but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it.     If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it. I have never found a book and readed it and found it affensive or disterbing. I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want any one to read it.      If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about anetirer race or to graphic for a yonge age.     My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it we see it all the time in the real world people do something because they dont like some one they try some extreame things to get rid of some bad marerial, but in any case is a lot in this world that people should know about and when i do have kids I will decide wether to block something if I wont to and that is how it should be
<START>

If I was givin the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on @CAPS1 are quite correct. I would defiently reccomend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions,backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books.      People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.'  @CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before.      Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book.      Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in  the world today

When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @CAPS2 a days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly.     Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this.

Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are used for peoples enjoyment. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libraries reading materials. Books give  people another way to learn new things, instead of in a class.       If the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed. If someone is walking into a library, they have to be responsible. Adults along with young adults have to know what they should read and whats not acceptable.      No one has the right to take a book off of the shelf, because they think its offensive. There are millions of book in the world that people find offensive. Theres not one perfect book in this world that doesn't bother somebody.     Every single book that is made today has a right to be read. Theres people out in the world looking for a certain book, magazine, movie, and even music. That material is hepling find the answer to a problem, giving the right decision, and helping someone walk in the right path.      The @CAPS1 is a book of understanding and knowledge. There are a good number of people how think we shouldn't read it, or even pick it up. Like the @CAPS1 say, free will. It's our free will to pick up books we want to read.     Books give people another way to learn new things. Adults and kids get a lot of information out of the libaries reading materials. Books, music, movies, and magazines are used for people's enjoyment

Should offenive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an american citizen.  If you think books should be censored, then think about this.  Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive?  I do not think so, those words give power to the book.  @CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture.  Taking away these books will limit education.  Books should not be censored.         I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man.  In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently.  A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story.  I agree with the latter statement.  The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers.  I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word.  The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then.  When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.       Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship.  On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate.  It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch.  If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it.  The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents.  Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it.

Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves.     The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' @CAPS1 is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new.     The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored.      The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend.     While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having  a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help?  Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries
<START>

Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves?  That is ludacris. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely.     We all have seen or heard of books that are inapropriate to certain audiences.  It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs.  It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it.       One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a complete different libraries or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials.  I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section.       Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book.  For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it.       I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing.  They wanted me to be a child as long as possble.  They knew if i was reading or listening inapropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast.  I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me.     To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids.  I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing.  It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen

Should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves?Should movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant?     Magazines are offensive, they always have been, they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said. There are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebodys life, say things about people.Music is just words and sound, they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past , that people would find offensive. I have seen a music video about @PERSON1 and making fun of her being in jail, but do i think that should be taken off the computer, no its entertaining.This world needs something to keep us intertained. Imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi. We wouldnt know anything going on around the world, and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, i can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especialy about mistakes you have made in your lives, but thats how the world functions, thats always going to be apart of everyones lives,talk.     So as i have been saying, getting rid of movies,music,magazines,books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, cause what would entertain us if they were gone?

Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech.     In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like.     So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff. but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art.

Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.

You are not elgible to check out this book', says the libranian. You are just too young for this book.      To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyonee takes things in differently, being said some are mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore they are held accountable for their actions. Isnt that how legal laws are carried out?     If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves. Something @MONTH1 seem offensive to one person but someone else @MONTH1 find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @MONTH1 say things tha offends his?her fans. They people who are not fans of him/her @MONTH1 find it ammusing; so they should remove the post because some people dont like it. Someone @MONTH1 like that book, music, movie, or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people.           Interest @MONTH1 vary, but a teen @MONTH1 like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws wont  let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Cencorship laws should be wiped out completly. If you @MONTH1 find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just dont read it. Nobody is forcing to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy.     In conclusion, certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other peoople @MONTH1 like that same aterial. There shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair, and unjust to some people. Its a new time and age and things are different. People of any age should be able to check out any book they please

The things we find in libararies shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make rather you won't to read it or not. Nobody is making look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive.     The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaning when watch or read stuff like that.     That hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like thats what people wan't to see. True enough thats what people won't see as long as it's not effecting them in no kind of way. That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have on problem reading or watching a book about it. I see stuff offensive on tv about everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I woudn't care because i'm use to seeing it on tv.     Nobody can make read or stop reading things like that, only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because thats what we hear and see everyday. No matter what some people find that entertaning.

What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of.  Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing.  Does censorship really help in our society?  Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory.  How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.     Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows.  In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.  Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more.  Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version.  I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version.  Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television.  Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words.  That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later.     Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows.  I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory.  I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister!  She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her.  Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie.  I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either.  Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right?     Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics.  So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it.  Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song.  That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular.  I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were.  When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me.  Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.     Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things.  Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do.  My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.

I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves.     For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive. In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten.     Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In the reality it was a hard time for the africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation.      If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible. Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well.      In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them, but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future.                                                  this is an essay by @PERSON1

Older authors love to write grusome stories about their pasts, whether it's fiction or nonfiction. Sometimes those books can get into the wrong hands and end up in the trash or burned. Other times parents get angry at what they're children are doing and saying, and they normally blame television or other kids at school. Parents don't always look at the big picture.      Any child at anytime can walk right into their school or public library and pick up an inappropriate magazine,book, or movie, but parents don't usually catch on until it's too late. There are all kinds of books out there and no two books are the same. Nobody can tell a book is going to be inappropriate just by looking at the front cover. Even though books are meant to be read, it doesn't mean they should be read by all age groups.      No book at any point in time should be completely removed from a library, that's just not right. No matter how graphic, perverted, or inapproriate a book can get, it should never be thrown away. Those certain books are written for people with those kinds of interests. Even books about drugs should be allowed to be read, some children or adults could be interested in what they really do do to your body and mind, and they'd rather read a book about it rather than trying it themselves. Books about murder should also be allowed to be read, but not by children under twelve. If people in libraries would just start putting books in organized age groups then there probably wouldn't be any problems.      The author should never be blamed for something they wrote. It's their own personal thoughts and feelings and most of all it's their story. It's how they wanted it to be written and nobody should get mad over that. The rule should apply for magazines, music, and movies. Those people wrote the books, movies, magazines, and music so it should be expressed the way they wanted it to be. Even if the authors themselves thought their own writing was too bad for a child to read, or hear they would make it clear by putting something like, 'not for children under the age of twelve or whatever age they recommend.'     If adults are really getting mad about this then they need to look back at the kinds of things they were doing, saying, or reading and maybe it would change their outlook a little on movies, magazines, music, and books.

Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you?     There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!

I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents. I would not whant my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you wether if its write or wrong, I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are bieng tought bad things. I believe that there are some movies that are to violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch any way. There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them to. No matter what they make there will be people who dont like what they see or they know somebody who didnt like what they saw.Some times there are people that dont like what they hear, or knows somebody who didnt like what they hear'd in music or on the television.  There are times my mom here's something on t.v or music and said turn that of. my friends all listen to this music that i dont think amounts to nothing but the production of inmates, and other wrong doings such as, gangs, fights, shootings, and jurry trials. there are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies. Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw, becuase they think that it will make them look cool. There will always be things that peolpe do not like and will never like. I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have. I think the biggest thing that sell's, is the dramma, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like. Very little of baby movies, and baby music. But what can you do about that? I like most of what I hear, and see. I have always thought there was a lot of violence, and picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young.This is what I think.

Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!     It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!

In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children.  These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing.  However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc.  The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational.     When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were to young.  Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough.  They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies.  The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them.  If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library.  They do not want to be reading children's books all the time.     Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies.  Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it.  The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them.  Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game.  They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies.  It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'.     Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos.  For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.  These wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars.  If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened.  There is no point in trying to hide the truth.     Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content.  Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it.  So why woyld we try to hide this from them? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country.
<START>

Do you think @CAPS1 is going to prevent people from getting offended? Taking items such as a books, music, movies, magazines, ect., will not stop people from getting offended. The @CAPS2 question's are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive
<START>

Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction
<START>

Do I belive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive @CAPS1 choice is no. I have several reasons for that one is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or whats on there mind. And that should be aceptable any where cause every on has their on opinion about what they like or read. And if you feel that it offen you maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or what ever the case @MONTH1 be. You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family @MONTH1 like,                    @CAPS1 second reason is that you can learn from stuff that @MONTH1 offen you and any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging there pants many white people that seen there pants below there waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only jugde a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person, that they was talking about and one of the black males was a honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why. He told them this is a free country I can do what ever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self.                               So with @CAPS1 reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials,such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading @CAPS1 essay. If you have any arguments or questions you can surely contact me
<START>

No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.     The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.     Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.     A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.      Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?
<START>

I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three catagories are very sensitive issues, some @MONTH1 not be comfortable disscussing these issues.      Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading.     In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions.      Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree.       Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don''t agree with what it says? Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they arn't reading something they shouldn't

'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?'     Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world.     There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.      I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.     Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future.     There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.

Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know I would not.  If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality , we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.      If you ban a book then you are giving up your indiviuality. If you let someone decide what is offesive to you, then how can you express yourself. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.      There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.     If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them.  There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and  if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.     In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books , more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our indivuality.

Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed form a libraries shelf?     A libarys should carry every kind of book, movie, Magazines, Music etc.  The reason that a libary should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the oppiset would happen.  Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if @PERSON2 dose not like viloence so they take it off the shelf and @PERSON1 dont like chick flicks etc what would that leve in a libary no one would have anything to read and they would close the libary down because there would only be a few books.  The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was approperat and if it was rated @CAPS1 you had to be @NUM1 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certon thing so what are they going to do make seperate libarys so that each culture will be happy or just build one big libary and the ones that dont like just leve the book or whatever there.  Altmentley its up to the parent to tech there chiled noy yo pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certin family or cultuer.  If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss custmers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad becaues a libary carryes a certian type of item then to loss custmers and make @NUM2 people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up.     So altimently we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your childern not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem

I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries.  I think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it dosen't mean remove it.  They don't have to read that book.  If I did like a book i just don't like it.       everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into.  Like im in to freaky novels.  Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels.  In I mite not be into what they are into.  Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like.  I can say I am in to abnormal stories.  I like fiction stories then nonfiction.       My most favorite novels is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'.  Most people would want to remove the stories with bad lauguage or vocabulary off the shelevs.  I know a lot of poeple that are into those kind of stories.  I think that would be unfair to do that.  Why take away what they like in not what you like.  Like I am into all kind of sex books.  Some poeple wouldn't want those books on the shelves either.         Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore.  I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read.  Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you.  How would you feel if that was to happen to you.  So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of veiw.         You should look at all the possitive way first.  Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books.  Not olny would it effect the read but the person who wrote the book.  You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people.  You would be putting someone out their job.  You could mess up someones family of living.  You could take away somones belifes.          You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad.  You can drive a person crazy.  You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all.  Books could be a way people escape the real world.  Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way.         I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at.  Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc.......  Life is hard in books makes it eaiser for some people

No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it.     When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes.      Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book.

@CAPS4 I think all books,music,movies,magazines,etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary. Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means.  Then, I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear. The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group.    Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too. Things that doesnt control their language such as(@CAPS1 @CAPS2). I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show. Finally, magazines...I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not. I think that etc.. should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things.    Inconclusion, All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch. Because children pick up everything they hear and see

I don't think they should remove anything thats offensive from the library cause honestly, most of the books author publish have something offensive in @CAPS1. I'ts not the library's fault, if there's children reading these books that are offensive then that's the parents fault for letting them read them. I've been to the library and listened to music, watched movies, and even read magazines that have some offensive content in @CAPS1, but if they weer to remove all the offensive content from the library, then the library would be half empty.          I've seen parents discussing to the librarians about banning content thats not appropriate from the library, but why would @CAPS1 even matter if they can just ignore @CAPS1 and keep @CAPS1 away. @CAPS1 honestly isn't a big deal when @CAPS1 comes to these type of problems. I discussed this with my mom once and she completely agree's  with me. My mom said ' @CAPS1 would'nt be a problem as of today if they could of just ignored @CAPS1'. Also the music that they have should stay their wether or not its offensive cause people like to express themselves with the music that they listen to. The movies that are made these days all have innapropriate content in @CAPS1, wether its a rated @CAPS2 movie or not.          As of all the argument going on about library's having offensive content, @CAPS1 should still be kept at the library and not removed. I'm sure alot of teens and adults enjoy all the content that's kept at the library. If children end up listening to the offensive music, or watching offensive movies then think about @CAPS1 like this, they need to grow up someday. If that's not the case then parents should keep them away from the content

Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had  the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive.      To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by.      In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library. Adult novels, childrens book, science finction novels all in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiousity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such seeing something that a  toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see.      One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lesson are not tought yet, they will be tought later. In a harder way. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it. That is why some material should not be taken away.      Everyone believes in different things. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains of many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do. Someone has to find a way to fix things and in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others. Removing material from libraries can cause many things; approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and people find that wrong, then it means they do not experience life

Censorship is not an easy question to anwser; it involves a great deal of thought. When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture. You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else. When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves.      So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books. This way other people can read these books.  If you truely think about it, then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it. If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more.     Books are good for people. It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read. So, maybe some books are more racie than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children.      If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems. Now you will have no books for some people. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together.     So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books. Books are good for people especially teens, whos minds are developing. In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated. When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from

You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people. We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel?

When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community. Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material.  This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? And when?'.     As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject.  Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read? Or listen to? Or watch?  The answer I came to was 'no one'.  No one has the right to censor anyone else.  This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose.     This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials.  Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me.  Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show.  These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate.  We must, as a society, be able to accept this.     We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn.       Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists.  If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn.  Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect

Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts. Therefore, I do not believe that libraries should have to censor the books that are supplied for the citizens to check out.      Everyone is faced with choices in life. Some are more difficult than others and will have a greater impact on your life. We decide if we want to wear the black shirt or the grey shirt, the blue shorts or the brown shorts. Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault.      The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book.      Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen.      If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers.     I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display
<START>

Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well.      If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be.     Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world.     Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used.      Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be.

There are many different styles of  literature and media in this world.  With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There come a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves.       Media is a huge influence in todays society.  What would you do without it?  Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the televison in the moring and watching the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time.  You cannot get away from it. Teens @CAPS1 are truely addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and moives.  Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health.   Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong.  Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we?  @CAPS1's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide.       Music can get too extensive as well.  Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didnt know people like the thought of a @CAPS3.  Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living?  People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling realived after they have listen to it. You @MONTH1 be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad?        Too many lives are effect by @CAPS1's media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined.  Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves.  We are not like a video game that has seconds lives

Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library
<START>

Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf
<START>

Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offenisve? There are some things in books are movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldnt watch or read. Reading a book also says alot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on tv.     So I dont think that certain things that are found offenisive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because their not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant. The problem I think is people @MONTH1 not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean. Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look what's on tv and copy exactly what they are doing. They also @MONTH1 be a role model which is not always good for some people.     Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example if you are listening to a sad song, you @MONTH1 feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music @MONTH1 feel upset or angry. Certain music that peole listen to can define who they are. Especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood there are in.     Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, youre going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you @MONTH1 want to do things just as the what the magazine. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things.       Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person @MONTH1 read something about voilence he or she @MONTH1 think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic. So no I dont think that some books that are found offensive beacause only that person or indvidual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books @MONTH1 help other people who are readers.

What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea of @LOCATION1 in those catagories is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.     Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.     Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?     I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.      That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.      We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right.      Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2.      That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways. It helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living.

There are alot of things that u can find in the libraies that you can find to be inapporite to some but not all people. if there was something that i was ofined by then i would ask them to pull it off the shelf. if u have somewhat of a project to do then go to the libarie to meet some friends and work on it there. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The libarie is here to help those that dont have a computer at home, they can go to the libarie and do there work there.               If they would have alot of there books on a disc or dvds,movies,tape players alot more people would want to read more. If that all libarie had all the same books  then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them. All the libarie should get ride of the inapporite books that some of the people right off the shelf so that they dont have people complaing about the material on the shelf.     Theres probale about @NUM1 to @NUM2 libarie in the @LOCATION1. I know for fact that there something inapporite on the shelf in all ther libaries. There are tons and tons of books in all of the libarie so theres a good chance there something out there that someone will find they dont like and ask for it to be taking off the shelf. if they would get alot of people saying they are offenied by it then they would have to take it off.     There is also alot of magasins out there that some should be seen to little kids. if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that. all magasins should have some what of a rating on them. you would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg-@NUM3 mag. some of the magasins should be for little kid that go there all the time and adult. they should have them divid into sections for little kids and adults. They need to respect all the people in the libarie at that time. I think that theres some of that here in are home town but not @PERCENT1 postive there is. We all have the right to ask them to take it off the shelf and if they dint then they well get into trouble

Dear newspaper editor,      @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers.     Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like. Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems.      Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religon or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alchol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left @CAPS3 be childrens books. Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well. We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature.     Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores.      This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we dont need to censor anything, as we are a free country.      So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, '@CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer.
<START>

Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups. Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not?     I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say.       Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell
<START>

What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries.      I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have.      I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it.     So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems
<START>

To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good
<START>

My opinions on the censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books. I don't believe that books, music, movies, magnizines and other things should not be removed off the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist. Also people want to learn the lyrics to the song.     The reason why books shouldn't be removed off the shelves is becuase people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book. Books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television. Also people used books to study for the book is going to be read and then going to be tested on. The books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them. Unless some people are not mature at all and can't read books that are not even talking about them.     Movies shouldn't be removed off of shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them. If a movie is very offensive to the people, yes it is probably best to remove the movie because they don't want to watch it anymore. But other movies are not even bad. Yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it. But sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the @LOCATION1. Then everybody starts saying the foul language. People just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed.     Magazines shouldn't be removed because people love reading magazines especially sports related. I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school. There are very inappropiate magazines that children shouldn't be reading and they should be removed off of shelves. Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework, as for ladies makeup, perfume, etc. People think that magazines are very important to the society
<START>

Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore

Having libraries is a good thing because it teaches children to learn how to read and get examples from the book or magazine that they are reading or just looking at it. How can they help with children and family memebers that hardly ever knew how to read and write about them. Some libraries have shelves some of them dont that is crazy but silly to.Libraries have books and magazines that is for children and also for adults and even grandparents. How can they tell if there is a position that you have to put your books on bookshelfs and on a cart. They would have to have alot of respect and also alot of body work to put the things that need to be in the library. Librarians can have more than just books they can have cds, computers, and also a table that has coloring pages for children.I think they need to be removed because i wouldnt want my children going in the library and finding a whole bunch of stuff that they dont even know what it is about. This would be a wonderful thing to do they should not have stuff like that in a library in the first place. The librarians should convince the person that brought those in there and tell them to take them back where they got it from.I would think that they should just put stuff that would usually go into a nice and quite place to sit down and read and also there is other options computers to do your homework on. Librarians can have stuff like that that is wrong that children see that all the time this is ridiculas and un called for that can teach  them bad stuff they shouldnt be doing.How can they tell if they shouuld convince them to not have unappropriate things that should not be in a library that children should not see. They could take a book home that they dont even know what it is about or what might be in it that should not be in it. I think they should just take everything that is approprate and just send it somewhere else where it belongs instead of where little children can reach and learn whats going on.

'@CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          @CAPS2 do people take @CAPS1 books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be sensored or 'band'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this eassy. The three topics are children, @CAPS4, and religion.          First, '@CAPS3'. Many parents themselves don't want there child to be exposed to viloence, volgure language, or even possible drugs. Viloence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing there child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidty. Another is volgure language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death.          Second, '@CAPS4'. Many people going from black to whites to eveyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racsism, meaning against ones color or there ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certian people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang viloents to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancentors did them in the past.          Third, '@CAPS5'. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows alot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theres is the right way and someone elses is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one an another. So trying to keep them from bein banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right.          So back to @CAPS2 would everyone or some take to @CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from there experience so why banned now?
<START>

Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about
<START>

I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books.  Also the little  kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that.  The bigger kids like in grades @NUM1  should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before.          The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries, like the books thatis called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times, a other one is @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age.       Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home.  If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades @NUM2 becaues the that the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read.     Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books.  Why should the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are. The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom, dad, grandme, grandpa, and ect.       Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newpaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get reid of the consorship in the libraraies.  Also until the next time I right again about this topic and I hopest you like this persuasive essay for the newpaper.

Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.

I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen

There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society
<START>

Now, one way or another that certain peice of material will be found and be used.     Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So really, either way you @MONTH1 try to remove any material that you think is offensive but is it your right? I don't suppose so, I would consider that unfair. It's unfair that you were able to see this material and just because you thought it was offensive, it does not mean that others @MONTH1 find that offensive in their opinion.     So the idea of pulling them off the shelf for your own selfish opinion is ridiculous. For you to do that would be defeating the purpose of being an @CAPS1 for the author of that material. Having the freedom to sell or convey something they want viewers, readers, listeners, etc. to look at and use, would not happen because a person or a small group of people consider it offensive. It's big world out there, you think just because you can try and hide certain material from people in your area to see, that no one will find a way, people will always find a way for it to get out or be found.     It would be as if your trying to control what people should be viewing, listening, reading, etc. Almost as if your in control of people, but you got to realize that you can't hide everything in this world. Also that not everybody in this world has the same mind set as you do, and that what ever you find offensive @MONTH1 not, or actually does not mean everyone else does.      So this leads to my conclusion that it should not be your right to remove material from shelves that only you or group of people find offensive. Do not try to control what people or childeren should view, listen, or read becuase it will be found sooner or later. No matter how hard you want this world to be perfect, reality is that it won't happen and you can't keep everthing hidden

Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf.           It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it make  kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be. They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble.           With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, televsion, and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe. So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see. Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it.

Things that mean so much to just one person     @CAPS1 to start this off, I am going to say Katherine Paterson is saying / @CAPS2 what is correct.They're is alot of @CAPS3 around this world that is very senceitive about there things in there house and around there life that they wouldnt want anyone to touch. Or be around.     One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my @CAPS4 is the @CAPS5 that my @CAPS6 gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my @CAPS4 have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time. But we just cant get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that @CAPS5 and just grab ahold of it. @CAPS1 me and my @CAPS9 do not like that. So we say something. Thats one thing that we @CAPS10 like for anyone to touch. Because it means so much to us!      Most @CAPS3 think we are crazy because we @CAPS10 like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there is other @CAPS3 around this area that is more crazy about there things being touched. For example: ' @CAPS10 be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I @CAPS10 want you to knock it off, so get away from it! ' That is something that my bestfriends @CAPS11 had said before. & she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean its just how we feel about everything around us that means alot.     But to get back to the situation about why do @CAPS3 get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and thats where they have been for years and years. Its because it means so much to them. Its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, & when I say means alot to them, I mean a bunch bunch!! There just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what there trying to say to you. Because it could mean so much. & you could get to the point to watch out for it also. Just to help out.     But the store that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing. & she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her. You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of @CAPS3 that have impotant things in there life, & you could be one of them. Just try to see & feel how alot of other @CAPS3 do around the world around you. Just have to remember whats important to someone and help keep an eye out with them. & because a good friend to everybody else.

What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one

Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library.
<START>

We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It @MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it.
<START>

When going to a library you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items. If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldnt be able to control those situtations, because it's a persons choice or adults choice to read those kinds of stories.     In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the @CAPS1. The @CAPS1 includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters. If a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law its ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works.      Libraries are government funded organizations. Therefore meaning they dont have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library. This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some gruops of people might not agree its there job.      I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because thats what our country is meant to stand for freedom. When I think of @LOCATION2 i think freedom, and i have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should  stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life
<START>

Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care @CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want @CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, @CAPS1 if we do not then us as @CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just @CAPS1 eather you dont belive in @CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.

Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me I dont.     I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are o lot of people in the world after all.      For music there's different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others @MONTH1 like country and want to listen to it.     For movies there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies. People always have a choice.     Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature

The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want.

Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things. Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings. I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better.     From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock.     Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also so stupid stuff. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone

Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish.

First of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, Then it shouldn't be their, @CAPS1 my oppinion.     Parents @MONTH1 think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. @CAPS1 not their choice though. Anything is alowed to be at a libray. If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. Help them pick out a book.     In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. Kid or if your an adult. If your not alowed to get, then why is it their? I dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? @CAPS1 my oppinion though

'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book

I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, @CAPS7 it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also @CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries.     @CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press. In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.     Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature.     A personal experience I have was one day @CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the @DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, @CAPS5 friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then.     @CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, '@CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' @CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.     After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. '@CAPS6's that?', he said. I said, '@CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, @CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said.     Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away?

Some people often go to the library to check out books,movies,magazines,etc..But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people. I think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there. Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason. So honestly it cant be that bad.          I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you dont like but you have to deal with it. If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people. But no one really makes a huge thing out of it.               The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read.With no intentive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning. Everything is for educational purposes. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that theres some pretty harsh things in it. But i didn't complain about it, I just kept reading.            Alot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies. So people can see what the author has to say. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion. And thats what most magazine articles are about. Expressing what you think about a certain topic.          Even in the @CAPS1 class that im in now we had to read 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3'. Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think its racist but it reallu isn't. The author is trying to get his point out. Of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it.          So I hope i got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people. As long as thats not the whole point of what you watching or reading. Which i doubt it is. So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you. Think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Mybe by it offending you it is getting the point across.

Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1. Libraries should censor some of there material.      Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored.     Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored.     Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2 it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated @CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, should be censored.     The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries.

As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf.
<START>

Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.
<START>

If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too.
<START>

In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either
<START>

Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.
<START>

Imagine that a person comes up to you and says, '@CAPS1 is that you are reading there? Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that!      Everybody should be able to decide for themselves @CAPS1 is right or wrong to; watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action.     Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. @CAPS1 fun is that? And I have to think, '@CAPS1 about the authors?' @CAPS4 thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship.     If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains @CAPS4 bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide @CAPS1 is appropiate? Would the @CAPS5 decide for us? Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself @CAPS1 is good or bad.     Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment?     Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship @MONTH1 be required. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up. When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves @CAPS1 food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are; public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are; profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender. Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves @CAPS1 they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end.     Total censorship is bad. Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to. And nobody should ever try to take that away. Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals.

Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.

Is it offensive?          Should people have the right to take down other people ideas? What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy.     I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers  and artists. But not all medias are good. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups.          @CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse.          This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media

Dear @CAPS1,                    To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2     @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book?  It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive.  To this I disagree.  The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field.  Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country.  To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint.         Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6.  In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech.  This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter.  This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips.  There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6.  However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.     The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant.  This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types.  No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future.  At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation.  The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten.  The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad.  To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope.     To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections.  A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher.  That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.     As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading.  To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential.  Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive.  Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information.  This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them.  We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children.  To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.

I'm ok with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the poeple selling the prodects want to appel to the eye and make poeple buy what they are selling. I have alot experience with this because I read alot of car magazines and they sometimes have alot models in them, but I'm your avage seventeen year old and I'm ok with this also, but there is a lamt.     My school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back , but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad they do tell me I can get, but if it's nineiy-five perent cars and only five perent models they are ok with that.     I said a thing about limt. All things have a limt like how much hosepower stock parts can take on a car before they break. I have a limt on what I buy sent I'm not yet eightteen I can only car magazines but don't get me wong I love cars and have sent I little

What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who?     The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure.     Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept.     If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases.     Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it.

Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.

'Can I read this?'  @CAPS1 a round the world have asked this or been asked this question. @CAPS1 have their own right to read what they want, but are the childern alound to? There are books that children or young adult should read and should not read. This @MONTH1 vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and @CAPS4 in books that for children should not read.     In highschool there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that has cursing in it. For highschoolers of @NUM1 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.      Will a parent let a @NUM3 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An @PERSON1 book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romanic was of writing to @PERSON1 books. A child of @NUM3 years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book.      @CAPS4! '@CAPS4 is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to @CAPS4. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it.     Over all there will be @CAPS4, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for @CAPS1 it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut

Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow much offencive material at all while others don't mind it. Also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offencive books, music, or magazines, from the shelf because different people like different content.     Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoice violence and offencive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed @MONTH1 not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out, are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier. In books, they @MONTH1 have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the @NUM1 and @NUM2, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy. It is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs. Some people @MONTH1 find that offensive and some @MONTH1 not.     Adult content is very differnt than children content. Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children content is based on the alphabet and sing alongs. There are also the more grown up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring mateirals, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way. They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch.     Different people like differnt content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent. An example one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a @CAPS4 of a company. As stated before, different people prefer differnt types of content.     All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their childern watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themsleves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch

Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.
<START>

Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes

Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god.     Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf. In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom.          In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends. It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom

I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information! hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they @MONTH1 be seen as offensive to a  minority of people................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racey pictures in them. Some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this. Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer. The easiest way to prevent children from listening to innappropiate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves.     Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want. The child could easily pick out an innopropiate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them. There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know. Thats why some books and music should be removed.      If you do not remove innappropiate books and music from the shelves you would have to have an attendent. The attendent would have to walk and around and check out what each individual kid is doing. It would be a lot of busy work and the libriarians are aready busy enough. Nobody really wants to do that so the simplier solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves.      Another opition if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out. If this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out. This is an easy way to get around the system. A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later. This is another example of how easy it would be to get around that system.      Therefore, the easiest way to aviod problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves. If this were done it is harder for the children to get the innopropriate books and music. If somebody needed to check out an innappropiate book for any reason, they could go someplace else. This is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe

Censorship?     Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.     Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it.     I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there.     If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you.

I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin

In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the sheld---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they @MONTH1 not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncencored material can be found on every shelf. As my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language.     @PERSON1's play '@CAPS2' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. @CAPS2 was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. @PERSON1 also discusses a 'strumpet' in '@CAPS2'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products.     Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like godesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful.     In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control you're life or let the media?

Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth.

People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it. Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it.           I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yea some parents dont care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school.     Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not. Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions. Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books.     This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your childs school

Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing

Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in librarys or some @MONTH1 not think it's so important.      Books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about @MONTH1 not be right or could be innapropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of librarys just some thngs shouldnt be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are innapropriate for children or people @MONTH1 find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.     Another reason why censorship @MONTH1 not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive or innapropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on @CAPS1 or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. @CAPS1 has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that @CAPS1 show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unecassary at the time when they mature they hopefuloly will see whay they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on @CAPS1 and not get involved with these activities.      Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the innapropriate and harmful things in todays culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right.     In conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.

You Are @CAPS1 You @CAPS2?     Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today.  People ask, '@CAPS3 much should be censored?' or even 'Should @CAPS9 be censored at all?'  @CAPS4 opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are reading, listening to, or watching materials.  Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent.  I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care @CAPS1 the child is reading, the distrubuters of the materials can't be punished.     In @CAPS4 experience, @CAPS4 mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age.  She is always interested in @CAPS1 I am reading.  Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to @CAPS2.  @CAPS4 mother has also censored @CAPS4 music by glancing through @CAPS4 music player and every so often, playing a song or two.  @CAPS9 discourages me from listening to anything that @CAPS4 mother wouldn't approve of.  I have also experienced censorship in @CAPS4 local library.  The library is divided into sections, begining with the children's books.  These books are appropriate for young minds and have no offensive material.  @CAPS9 section leads to young adult, then eventually the adult books.  The music is also similarly divided into these catagories.  I believe @CAPS9 is acceptable because there are certain materials and music that a young child should not be exposed to.     Through reading the book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' by @PERSON1, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in @CAPS1 their children are reading, listening to, and watching.  In @CAPS9 book, @PERSON2's parents simply left him alone while he was in his room.  They let him listen to his own music, and watch @CAPS1 he wanted.  @CAPS9 led him to listening to a @CAPS7 metal band called '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.'  @CAPS9 band influenced him to commit a homocide in his school, killing ten students.  @CAPS9 is a worst case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all.  Violence can have a large impact in young kids; therefore, they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature.     Through @CAPS4 reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population.  The novel '@CAPS10 @NUM1' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme.  Reading is banned in their society, except for comic books and sex magazines.  @CAPS9 shows that without a right to @CAPS2, society is reduced to very simple, uneducated creatures.  Censoring an entire people's reading is impractical.  @CAPS4 opinion is that once a person is an adult, they have the common sense and maturity to @CAPS2 whatever they choose.     Censorship is difficult to take a stand on because ther are so many posatives and negatives to consider.  @CAPS4 position on @CAPS9 vital subject is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or the reading companies.  Once a person is an adult, their right is to choose whatever they like to @CAPS2.  Reading is a magical thing that should not be held back from adults who are prepared to experience it to its fullest.  As long as society keeps a balance between the outcome of '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' in which censorship was not practiced, and '@CAPS10 @NUM1' in which it was enforced to the fullest, I believe that we have reached an appropriate balance.  Censorship is healthy for children, but restricting in adults.

Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certian types of book away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad. I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it. Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left. Nothing! Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect.     When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them. But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal. We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share. So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online. In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything.     How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not. Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them. Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time. In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt. When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't.     Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we  censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book.      Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth. It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what shuld be censored. And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end.

Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc.            In @CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things.           If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves. That would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape

What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers. The latest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance. All these things make up peoples lives. Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is.          Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read. Fiction or nonfiction? No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times. There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories. People will always read no matter what. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in. Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends. Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life.          Music is used for so many different things. It's often listened to when driving down the road. Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody. Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge. There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods. On most @DATE1 nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded. Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry. Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level. Movies can bring things to life.          Life is what it is from contributing factors. All people think differently and like unsimilar things. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensivc or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place. If anything it will take away happiness in the world. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described. Most often things that are offensive is the truth. Why hide things that are real? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions? All these things are comfort for some people.          Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is. They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies. In my own experience books make me interested in subjects, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do.They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life.

In this essay I am going to write about the books about the librabries. Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books. So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books.When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion. Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't.I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books.I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if they should or not remove books from the shelves
<START>

Books are an extremely important part of literature. Many different people have different views of different kinds of books. Some people enjoy books, and some people don't. Some people are fast readers, and some people aren't. Reading is in individual task. Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's.       The main idea here is preferences. You @MONTH1 enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else @MONTH1 find offensive. But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that meant that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself? Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out. Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it. Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like. For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them. Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others. Then, some people @MONTH1 not have the resources available that they need.     If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way.  People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent. If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that @CAPS1 or movie for someone else to enjoy. They shouldn't complain about it. How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere? Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do.      I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels. Every book, movie, @CAPS1, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too
<START>

People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility.     Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it.    What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad. that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8. These ads. are totaly uncalled for.     If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much.     These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive. So libraries be aware of what you put on your shelves and be aware of the consequences.
<START>

Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.
<START>

Magazines and Books     I am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violant roles in it.     First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. @CAPS3 me personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them @CAPS3 that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And @CAPS1 boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air @CAPS3 some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch.      The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic. But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. @CAPS3 it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that.     And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. @CAPS3 there is more cerse words in the @DATE1 than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines @CAPS3 they dont really intrest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on @CAPS1.     Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. I think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them. @CAPS3 if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children.      That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids dont need to know bad language at their age @CAPS3 that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them. And reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder mikght get it in a little kids head that that is ok. And that is not ok with me
<START>

Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored.
<START>

I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a persons opinion on something. We can't just disregard it because we dont like what its saying. Thats like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look. Or just anyone that we dont like how they look.     I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship. I @MONTH1 not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would. You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be.     I could get a book removed because it offends me. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me. People are offened by little things and should jut except the fact that other people have different opinions. It's just like judging a person for their race. They have differnt morales and values and you can't just change that in a person.     Like if you don't like this article just don't read it. Don't say other people can't read it because of your views. I don't think there should be censorship.
<START>

There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one if forcing them to read them.      I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an @CAPS1 religion. Some @CAPS2 might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @MONTH1 see it as educational learning.      I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @MONTH1 be coming to rent the book that day. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter.      I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found @MONTH1 be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today.      The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us
<START>

Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do
<START>

Empty @CAPS1     @CAPS2 is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about @NUM1 billion people. All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society.     To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place.     Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age.     Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything.     So @CAPS2 is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone.
<START>

If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is. Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to.
<START>

Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose.     These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the @LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it.     Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time.     As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well.     In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.

As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.

Libraries have so many books, and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves. If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read. So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read, or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea. If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about mested up things.           Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad

In all libraries you are offered a choice on which book you would like to choose. So if you want to read a book with no censorship or if you want censorship then you can. The libraries should not take away books because of the content, in my honest opinion it should be the readers choice and not someone elses.      When choosing a book you have to think, do I really want to read this? each book gives you a little description on the back of the book giving you a little inside so you can tell if you would like to read the book or not. I do believe if it has sugested content that you should not let little kids read them but at a high school level we pretty much are able to make choices for ourselves.      Music should not be censored because if  a song says something that you dont want to hear like cussing or sugestive content then just turn the station. You dont have to sit and listen to the song, you can change it with a click or push of a button. Songs that are on the radio are for enjoyment and entertainment so you made the choice to go to that station and listen to the music that is on it, you made the choice and nobody can make it for you.      With movies they have a description on the back that tells what is going to be in the movie and what it's rated, if you don't want to watch a moive with bad language or bad content you should not have chose the movie in the first place it is clear as day on the case what will be in it. On movie cases it even gives you pictures of certain scenes and if they seem a little sugestive then put it back and select a differnt movie.      Magazines are meant to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard. Magazines are stocked on shelves in stores and on the front will tell you exactly what is in the magazine itself. If you are really bothered by certain language thumb threw the magazine and see if it is approprate or not for you.      Libraries should not have to get rid of books just because some content, a person who walks threw those doors should be aware of what is in the library and what exactly they will find. In libraries they have catagorys in which certain topics are under, by going towards a selection it is saying that you understand what type of book it will be
<START>

Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it

First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this?     Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship

I feel that u have the right to chouse to remove setian books, movies, music, magazines but only if they are not apropreat for some people and children. Some people like thim others do not it all depends on who you are.      If I go to a library and the books I want are on the restricted list, the library should have a small fee some were arould @MONEY1 to @MONEY2 depending on the typ of book. For instance if i wanted the movie @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 and it was restrected i wouls pay something like a redbox rental fee.     That is what I think about restrecting sertion items from the library.                                                                            -@PERSON1

People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or atleast get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it? If someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it. I do not agree on censorship in our world.     Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information. How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the worlds greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' because it is true. People don't stop at just one, once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want.     When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for @CAPS1 movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away. There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books.     Although most fail to be banned right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year. So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future.     'Then we have no books left.' if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one. Saying no to censorship. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.

Many individuals vist different libraries all over the world everyday. Some for books, some for magazines, some for movies. Everyone has different taste so a libary is where they go, because they have absolutley everything.       Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books. It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no  limits on what  books, movies, magazines, ect., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefes/feelings on what they would like to read or see.     If libraries starting limitting their options, i don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much. Which means that an indivudal's @CAPS1 could go down. Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabualry and just excersizing their own eyes. By taking away someone's intrest, they won't read as much, or feel as free.     Just because someone doesnt like something, does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, ect., is offensive to someone they just just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someones mind of what they are interested in.     However limmiting the age groups for certian items would not be a horrible idea. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not approiate for a young child should not be aloud to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others.
<START>

Books now an days have action, romases, and, etc. So that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have. So they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @CAPS1, The @CAPS2 side, The @CAPS3,and all of the vampor books. It's because they have action, love, and etc.     The books that are on and off the shelf. Are maybe really good books. Some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not. Really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is. Because the book is  boring, or a old school book, they really don't have what the raeder is looking for. However the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. That book has gotten sold faster than the movies.     The reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because. The books from the movies like the @CAPS2 side. Is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie. I heard that, that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie. So their for poeple really like books that from a movie.     They are more reasons why poeple like books now and days. You don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone, ipod, itouch,ipad and a nook,etc. So now you dont have to go to a book store anymore. You can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books. They can however now just get them on the go.     So that is why books are now on the shelfs for good. Because you can get it on the go. But I believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book. Should try and  just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school

The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker.  The library holds books of past and current writers.  It also holds information on past and current events.  Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offenseive history, books, or newspaper articles.     Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history.  One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information.  Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it.  The holocaust was an event that became known @CAPS2 wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which was a major historical event.   The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship.  The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country it is today.  Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance.  If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history.  Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn.  Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed.     Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.  One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read.  An example is @PERSON2.  The author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2.  Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone.  Another examample is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1.  Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style.  The author writes a book how they want it to be read.  Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about.  @PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked.  Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.     Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles.  One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information.  It brought peoples attention to recent happenings.  It informed people of what was going on.  Getting rid of that is just another loss of information.  Newpapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assasination of @CAPS12 and @ORGANIZATION1.  Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today.  They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events.  An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh.  Articles about views on the death penalty.  Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles.     The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker.  There, they can read about past and current events.  They can also read classics by great authors.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.

Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 the world there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments. Here in @LOCATION1 we have the right to say,read, and write what we want,about anybody or anything. Censoship does exist in the @LOCATION1, and it is in the form of opoion that it exists.     I have read artricles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth,due to what is politicaly correct. I have heard of libaries taking down books that have a very strong political opoion, often these are books written by conservitives.I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming,proabable presidential nomanees. Being a conservitive myself,I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores,libaries, or other public venues.     I believe this because in @LOCATION1 we have freedom of press and,for these books not to reach the public is against that right and,the free-flow of ideas.You @MONTH1 ask way I believe this? I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.      Now that @PERSON1, is why all books should be in our libaries.I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored,so little children will not get a hold of @NUM1 I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. We the @ORGANIZATION1 are a republic,and we for over @NUM2 years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas.Why stop now?thank you @PERSON2

My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials
<START>

I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it.

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.     First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.     Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.     Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.     Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it.

Books on shelfs are there for a reason    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people     A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young.      Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it @MONTH1 be to strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they @MONTH1 be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people.     Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at.      Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to.      Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. Theres a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated @CAPS1, @NUM1, @CAPS2, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not.      There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive
<START>

As a fellow person of the community and a person who often vists the libray, I think that books,magazines,movies,etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason for this thought is because, although it @MONTH1 be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate.     Libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people. The removal of these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run.     I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways.  I have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words do to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where I am today.             Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something.      In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @MONTH1 provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it.

There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do.     If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many differnt things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person whouldnt be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive.     So what if a book found offensive was removed? there are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using wemon, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life.     No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child 'safe', just will not work these days. No matter hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next vorner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensiv and teach their children to do the same but, just beacause someone @MONTH1 not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's childer will not eiuther

Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history

The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves
<START>

I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about.           This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older.          Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it.      So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain.      I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home

If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, should they be able to get it removed? In the following I want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries.     If some parents see a book they are offended by, and they don't think their children should be able to get it from the library, they could just forbid them to read it. I don't think they should be able to remove it, even though they might think other children shouldn't be able to get it either, but that's not their decision. Every parent has to decide on their own, if they want their children to get certain books, but one parent shouldn't be able to decide for everyone else by removing a book.     Some people might be offended by certain books in libraries, but just because one person is offended by a book, doesn't mean that everyone else is going to be offended by it. Does this one person have the right to say that a book should be removed? It is their personal opinion that they don't like it, but by removing it they would also keep other people from reading it, and that is not fair. Different people like different books, and are offended by different books, so if everyone would remove a book they don't like from the library, there wouldn't be any books left. I think if someone is offended by a book, they just shouldn't read it. They could tell their friends and family not to read it, because they thought it was offensive, but in the end everyone should decide for themselves.     I don't think people should be able to remove books from the libraries, but if the library itself thinks a book is offensive, then they shouldn't have it. It is their library, so it's their decision what books they want to have there. i also think that when the library doesn't have certain books, because they really pay attention to the books they take in their library, that that should be good enough for other people.     So all in all I don't think people should be able able to remove certain books, because everyone has their own opinion towards what is offensive, and what isn't. We all should be able to read or see, what we want to, and not what others think we should.

Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive. Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own disgression and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people.      Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences. Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people. This is directed mainly to children, however. Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 put these offensive books in libraries then? Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups.      Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property. Everyone has the right to these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it @MONTH1 contain profanity, or inappropriate content. Some people @MONTH1 be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it. That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose.      We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so. Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone. Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting. Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children. However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or gaurdians.      In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places. Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate

In my experience some music is just too offensive.  They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people.  Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see.  The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly.     One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library.  There was a @CAPS1 on a shelf and she put it in her @CAPS1 player.  It  was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it.  I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age.  As soon as I put my ear to her head phones, I turned it off immediately. They should really watch @CAPS4 music they put put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words.  I don't think @CAPS3 would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities.     One other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature.  I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine.  I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, '@CAPS4 if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have.     I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become.  If this is true I certainly thing we should censor @CAPS4 we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library.  We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have.  We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read

no i dont think anything should be removed caz not everyone wants too look at the same thing i think if you dont like it dont look at so there is no need to remover it no matter what

'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from @PERSON1 voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored. Censoring things doesn'@CAPS7 make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable.     I think that things that are offensive should niot be removed from the shelf. Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch tv shows all of the time. When the censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. @PERSON2 wrote a famous book called @ORGANIZATION1. and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One if it offends you then you shouldn'@CAPS7 watch or read it. Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect.     There are two books that I read called the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @NUM1. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In @CAPS3 @NUM1 books are censored. @CAPS1 causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn'@CAPS7 fair for books to be banned. Also in the @CAPS2 a boy challenges his @CAPS6 society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in todays' media. Some example are @CAPS7.V shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them?     Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don'@CAPS7 read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored.

Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor

I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove. I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kid's dont like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us.      If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glade people invited these thing's. I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring.     Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entataining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, glossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better.     It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures. Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things.     Hope you get something out of what i wrote. This is how i feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books alot.

When @LOCATION2 was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the big kahuna. With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries with freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people.Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birth right to our future!     Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight.       Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator.      Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.       I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future

Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable.

I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.
<START>

I dont thank so due to the fact that most libraries in towns and cities are open to the public.  if the person or persons find the peice of material offending then they should pass the item.  or they can skim over it.  on the other hand the person or persons does have the right to freedom of speech but should not exceed their opinion above the level of the law.       if music is played in the library that others do find offended then in my opinion yes they should and can speak up for their rights.  books and magazines should be allowed in the public library even if they feel offended.  this is due to the fact that it is a public library and there should be many many different kinds of books.  this is because people hav different personalities which mean we wll like different things.  that does not mean that others can not speak their opinion because like i said earlier every one in the united states of america has the right to speak what is on their mind even though it @MONTH1 not be what others want to hear they can still do it.     well that is my opinion on what i think should happen.
<START>

I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controvesial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring  is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers, I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen. Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school.       I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropiate. My english teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', this book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4,and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropiate. Movies with strong language are rated for it's public so I don't think this should be a problem. Music in the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents.     I trully believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could stablish an age limit to check-out any controversial material. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge
<START>

As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense.  If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not.  That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself.  When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.
<START>

I believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate.      Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways. But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book.      When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse.      So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head.     As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing. Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older.     I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older.
<START>

Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1,     Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves?     Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc.      I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all.                                             Sincerely,                                                  @LOCATION1

We all have that favorite book, mine is ' OF @CAPS1 and @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 is a book I would recomend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover. My name is @PERSON1, and during @CAPS3 essay I am going to show you what I am talking about.      I love to read during the day. I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very anger. I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers. They can go to a public library where they're children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terriable things. I don'@CAPS4 know why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the @CAPS4.V's and but or rent them.     I have a best friend who lost is father to these sexual acts and pictures. My friends mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is becoming the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library. He doesn'@CAPS4 even reconizes that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see is father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did. I have had varies talks with @CAPS3 friend, but he said it isn'@CAPS4 hurting anybody, but what he doesn'@CAPS4 see is that he is hurting me.     Back in the late @NUM1's early @NUM2's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. That tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then @CAPS3 problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do @CAPS3 all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. @CAPS3 is where about  half of the libraries money is being made. The goverment tries to stay out of @CAPS3, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can.     The reason for @CAPS3 essay was to show why the process needs to be stop. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not suceed. That will not stop me with helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now

Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings.

There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else.

Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section. Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age.  Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.     In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section. For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores.     Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.     Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement. So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music.     As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age.

Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas.      We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. Everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us. To boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed and books should too.      Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries.      Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. Behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless. Do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world.      Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvment in adults and children. Please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems!

Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3      @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3.     Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are.      I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read.     Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up.

The material we read in books are sometimes offensive. Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads. I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes     The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing. The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends. Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band, singer or rapper, whatever.          Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics. Then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have rating were movies do. Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what.      This is were the internet comes into play. Most people have acsess to a computer. Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see. Internet is also use to educate.      The internet also opens up the doors to video games. Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom. They also play with complete stranger. Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, music, ect.., that send a bad message.           No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see. The only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet. Even if we do this there could always still be away.

One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies. Thats why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the book shelf of the library.     They shouldnt be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read. Only if they are doing what the parent says. Also the parents might think to much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get.     Although, if your one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen, and you realize that every kid doesnt know what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principle and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read, or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books.    Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very dissappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school.     If someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable. I would say to them that, its not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed.     Finally, thats the reason why books shouldnt be taken off the book shelf because some people like them, and if you are some of the kids or parents who dont like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't aloud to check them out

Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exctly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship. It is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, surpress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge. Therefore, I support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution.      America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy. What kind of civilization was @LOCATION1? Not one you would want to live in I suppose. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS3, or @CAPS4 authors. Later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion. If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen.      Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; We cannot just assume anything about families in general. I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @MONTH1 vary from another set of parents. If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. They could start with a disscusion about why the material is inapropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. It helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsiblity and respect.      In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. My answer is yes, and I belive it is the answer of my fellow @CAPS5 too. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home. It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion.

Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries.     A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries.     Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library.

Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them.     First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time.     Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual.     Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material.     Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out.      Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.

As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books.      In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.      So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that?

The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us.
<START>

I do not believe that such things as book, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries.      First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying @MONTH1 be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults. Also books give a message about how times use to be. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black @CAPS9 back then. Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around affending @CAPS9 and they don't even know what the word means.      Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie. Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen. So movies are definetly a stay on my list.     In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk  about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody. We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now. We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself. Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause. Especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2. So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before.     Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate.  Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seing those magazines on shelves of a library so nobody should be worried about that. Now some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person. So magazines are harmless to in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the @ORGANIZATION1.     In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere.

Somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexualy things can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music but noting like that becasue I think it should not be in music and books. One day I Think the @CAPS1.S.A will be ran by a woman.      @CAPS3 is noting wrong with that. Woman have the same rights as @CAPS2 do. @CAPS3 is some people that think woman are just @CAPS3 slaves, that is dead wrong. Woman and @CAPS2 are the same no matter what people say.      Katherine Paterson as the right idea though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say other because @CAPS3 is some people out @CAPS3 who just care about them selfs and acted what ever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. @CAPS3 are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That it why i think we should be able to take it off the shelfs     @CAPS3 was this one day I was in @CAPS4-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover becasue one day they @MONTH1 not be like @CAPS3 parents and have all the money in the world.      It @MONTH1 seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs becasue we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life.          All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what @CAPS3 wear and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid but when i see someone who drives a new car worth @MONEY1 it really makes me think about how someone as the money for this car and everything else.

Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.

As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.  As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.

The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting.      I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it. Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4.                                                                      @PERSON2

Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation.

Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves? I know that most people who agree that it would 'better' our kids if the didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self?     I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of it contens. If I look at a certain book and think, '@CAPS1 book is offending me and my beleives,' then I should just not read the book. Just becauseit is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offened someone else. Every book that has ever been written has effect someone, either in a good way or a bad way. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'      I remember when I was in second grade, there was these girl in my class who's mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremly engery at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why.Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying. The teacher never played the music in class again and was to afraid to play anyother type of music.     Since everyones views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book form the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     In conclusion, I strongly think that books, weather they offended someone or not, should be kept of the selves. Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with.

I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like @CAPS1 shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because @CAPS1's not treating people right. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material.      Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about @CAPS1. Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from. Its good to still have have books that are  offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive.     Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well in the library they will have generations of  books on offensive material. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know  about what happend back in the old days.     Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material @CAPS1 is just like talking a good book from you.      People can think what they want to think about offensive material. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1. This is why i think we should have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries

To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history

Many people have different views and opinions on things. No opinion or view is right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone.     Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty. They're the only one with the problem.     Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.     One person cannot make the desicions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. It might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it.      I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone

Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'

What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away

@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2           You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want right? Well in some libraries that isn't always the case. Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries.     In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out! The books might contain material that is more adult, but thats okay. For the books that are more inappropraite the library needs to offer an adult section. Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers. The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them.      Music in libraries should not be censorshiped. The lyrics might be inappropraite, but most teenagers listen to that type of music. For younger children they should not be able to check out a @CAPS3 that is more adult. In @CAPS1 opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music. Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library. The child should have parent concent to check out any music if under the age requirement.      I think that some movies should defenitely be removed if they are found offensive. Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section. In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material. At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not in a public library. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate!      Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that is exactly right. I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropraite content for a child that age. Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer. As children,they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right.      In public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not. It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen? Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material. Now that you know @CAPS1 opinion on censorshiped, maybe others will consider this an important topic, too
<START>

Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. Thats just a easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no!      I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more.

Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate. Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. Should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them? Children are very curious. They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do?     Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines. Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate; books should have those ratings too. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the libraian their @CAPS1. Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age. Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library. It could be a section that kids could not enter. Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate.     The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read. I believe that's the most we can do.
<START>

There are many libraries with many books, magzines,music, and movies.  Some of the things in a library are inappropiate for children. So the library makes a section for the adult's and a section for the children. There should just be a children library and then make another library for the adult's.  Then I also think that they should take the bad things of the shelf's at libraries.     So there are children books and there adult books. In most libraries I seen that they either have and upstairs for the adult's and they have a downstairs for the kid's.  They also have toy's down there for kids so if there parents want to go upstairs then the kids can sit there and play with the toy's.      Then I also think that they should take off the bad things on the shelf's.  Becuase wjat happens if a kid goes up with there mom or dad and opens a book and sees something very inappropiate?  So they should be taken off the shelve's in a library, and if someone wants to buy them then will have to go online or to the store and buy them.       The people that own the liobrary or are in the library should take all the bad magazines, music, books, and ect. off the shelf's. It is a very bad thing to have at a public place, and that should not be aloud.  The public libraries should take all the inappropriate things of the shelf's
<START>

Libraries have books, magizines, movies, ect.The library is a wonderful place to read in a quite place.It can also be an offensive place to some people.They think they can complane and bikker about it, But should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose oppenion is it anyways.          If I found an offensive book, movie, or magizine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently its not a bad thing because if it was they wouldnt have it on a shelf. So if I got offensive by it I wouldnt look at it or pick it up. I mean its that simple.A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many diffrent people like diffrent books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put what ever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people.           With my experences in a library nothing has came across to be offensive to me. Im a kind of person that dosen't care. However I have seeen so books ware the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also @CAPS2 seen a book ware the author is writting about the black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it witch is a major racism to black people.                   It could be a unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and a inapropreate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents .Or it could even be in a magizine. But why should the books magizines and ect.. be tooken off the shelfs when its not effensive to all people? If the libraians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left. Everyone has diffrent things that can offend them. If you dont like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you.      Books, movies, magizines and ect are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are then dont look at it or read it. Its that simple get it or dont
<START>

If we remove all books we think should't be on the shelves. What would there be to read? So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people. Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music. Or put the books some people find offensive in there own area.      If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what were buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it. Books should be the same way. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a labe identifing that they could be offenisve to others. I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way.      I think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let there childeren go near them because they have been labled. And like rated '@CAPS1' movies a minor needs to be with an adut. But with books you should be find with your own choice at the age of @NUM1.      In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done. There's a bunch of books i can think of that would not be suitable for young childeren. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased.          Many parents complain about what thier childeren read, watch, or listen to everyday. Labing would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it. I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to labe them so others know what they are going to read or see. I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our childeren don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out

Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,    I've recently finish reading a quote of the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her feelings towards the certain type of material use in books. For example some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offended be certain type of language used in books. Other @MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite approprite. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead.      My beliefe is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the oppertunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. @CAPS1 shouldn't be allow to give hateful opion just because they didn't like a book. As I see it no one is forcing them to read it.       Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reading. As a matter of fact I barely read but when i do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading. The way authors discribe things even with sometimes profanity is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 be horrible but to others it @MONTH1 be the best book in the world.       So if you do start taking down books from the shelfs you would ended up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider, ' The perfect book.' @CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments.       This world is to big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling. So tell me, what's your belief then?
<START>

Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about
<START>

Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children.  I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents.

Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings
<START>

Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not.     We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for.     Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?       When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to?      In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.      I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us
<START>

I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that.  Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us.  Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not.  If they do not want to, then they do not have to.  Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.       Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be, they do not have to read it.  I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.     However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there.  Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them.  But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.       Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example.  In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly.  But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience.  She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help.  This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through.  Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.     Books are not the only things that might offend some people.  In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively.  Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned?  No, and why might that be?  Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.     Another place is the @CAPS2.  If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books.  Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2?  No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too.  If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library.  Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics.  I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer.  Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.         So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained.  Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from.  Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out.  After all, we are not forced to do anything.  All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own
<START>

Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive.  Books, movies, and music were created for a reason.  It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge.  Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.     Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive.  Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society.  If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated.  The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.     Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information.  People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing.  The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make.  It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves.  If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material.  Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.     Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought.  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone.  It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening.  Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.     Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us.  Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material.  There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.     Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason.  Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too.  Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.

Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?     There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.      In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.      I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong.      It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?

I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just too protective. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older.      The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is.      Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that catergorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library.      The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be seperated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period.     A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they @MONTH1 just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors.     All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit

To remove or not to remove     Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.     To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not. personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books. But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion.     Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not. personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world auccualy is. It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress.      Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them.      In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo

I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.

There are many books, music, movies, and magezines in the world. Some are humorous, historic, or romantic, however some are offensive in some way. People @MONTH1 get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf? Some people @MONTH1 find something offensive while another person does not, therefore the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves.     If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive? People are intitled to their own thoughts and feelings, however that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's. If everyone tried to make everyone happy then there wouldn't be a lot of options to chose from in the library. If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left.      With entertainment it is hard to please everyone. No matter what it is there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it. This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. If one person does find it offensive then there is most likely someone else who doesn't. The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too. It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done?     If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it. People can chose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they @MONTH1 find offensive. They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it. This way the person who isn't offened can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library.      If I find something offensive I try not to pay attention to it. There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those. By avoiding these books or songs I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy. I still am satisfied and so are they.     The library workers know what they are doing. If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours. A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers becuase then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them.      People have the right to voice there feelings but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them. It is impossible to make everyone completely satsified but there are compromises. The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive

Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them

Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion.       In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf. But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material.     If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores.     Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc.      I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores

Dear sir or mam,      Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every  book, cd, movie or magazine  from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves?     I believe that alot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one.           I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book,magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy them that certain thing wouldn't beable to obtain it.If everyonewere to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then their wouldn't be very much left for the community.     In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the communities choice. If someone wants a good book,magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts

Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'

Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge.      I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive.      In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age.      Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time

I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be allowed to read books that have inappropriate pictures on them. Censored material can have bad influences on children. Scary movies can make children have nightmares. There should be restrictions against offensive materials.     Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. Libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids.     Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to say cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death. Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries.     Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them.     There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a bad effect on children. I believe libraries need to restrict items that will have a bad influence on children.

Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents reponsibility, it's the library's.      The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect. Whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong.      The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway.     It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read.

Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive  books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf.          People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf.          Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody.          Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed.          Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that

It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive.          There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression.      People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If  libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material.      Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered.      'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library

I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion
<START>

I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you. People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's there children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language but thats there opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson).     If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child.      Many people don't like foul language but, that's there opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story.     Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you?

Removing certain books,music,movies,magazines,and so on is a serious question to ask.Well,some believe its a good idea,on the other hand other people dont. If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books,movies,music,etc.     One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion.Some @MONTH1 find a book offensive,well on the other hand some @MONTH1 find it riviting and not offensive at all. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simpily not read it.They should not have to band books,music,movies,etc. just because some find it offensive .Well others @MONTH1 find things offensive that the other person does not .We all have are own beliefes and we should be free to express them,as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws.     Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books,movies,and so on is because we might not have any left.Like i said before we all have our own opinions.Not every single person is going to say a book,etc. doesnt offend them.We should not have to take away certain items.But on the other hand i believe we should restrict certain books,moves,music,etc. If a book,movie,etc.,seems to complicated for a child to comprehend,then they should not be able to read,watch,etc.,the item.We should classify things based on knowledge,understanding,and maturity.     Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices.I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books,and movies,etc.,but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone.I just dont see that removing every book,movie,music,etc.,will solve any problems .In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse.Their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to.     In conclusion I belive we should keep libraires the way they are.It would keep things less complicated. Also it would be the best choice. i\

A @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 there ever a time where there @CAPS3 a movie that you wanted to see, but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it? Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing. What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more.     Frist of all, if they kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneek in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal. I remember when I @CAPS3 younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies. So we would have our parents drop us off. When we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing.         Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religous beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk. Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behide their parents back. Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie frist then they will decide if it is approprite for their child to watch. In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, fore if the adult gives premission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home.    Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored. For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another. Whether it's at a friends house the internet, or going to the theater. What harm could it cause to see it now.      So in conclusion to my statements.To know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censore it. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true. Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 wold? I know I can't. So think are you for or against censorship. Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I know I wouldn't

There are all kinds of different people in the world. People with different views on things, people with strong opinions, people who are very outspoken and mature and alot of those people are authors of the hundreds of books that fill our libraries at school. Some schools censor certain books from schools because they think the tone or message is inappropriate or too violent, but I believe that we have a right to these books.     In my opinion no book should be censored from the library. We have troops fighting for our freedom of press and freedom of speech and censoring books completely ignores these wonderful freedoms our country has given us. During my freshman year we read a book called '@CAPS1 @NUM1' and before we read it our teacher told us a little bit about what it is about. She said the book was about the way a society had banned books like they were drugs or something that could hurt us. Now apparently a school didn't like the idea of a society banning all books so they banned this book from being read to their children.  Now if you actually read this book they portray how bizzare and crazy this would be to have all books banned but here we are banning a book about banned books! Does this make any sense?      To be honest by the time you are in high school you have probably seen, heard, and done crazier stuff than what people put in the 'banned books'. Now I know there are some people who would say just because you do things that you should not be doing in the first place does not mean you @CAPS2 to read about it all the time and fill your head with ideas about it, and I agree on some level because most of the stuff high schoolers do they shouldn't, but thats life, plain and simple. In my opinion, high schoolers really are mature enough to handel some offensive language or violent scenes because I'm sure they see worse stuff on the televison or sometimes in their own homes. One of my good friends is @NUM2 years old, has two jobs, her own apartment with her boyfriend, and is not supported by either of her parents. Now this girl still goes to high school and has great grades and is obviously very mature for her age but yet even she is not allowed to read a book with some offensive language in it.      I think our society 'babies' us a little to much because when we get out into the real world things are not going to be censored or kept quiet. I think high schools @CAPS2 to put these books into the libraries because it might help some kids grow up and become more mature. When we go into the work place after college and start our lives with careers, homes, and families we @MONTH1 be to immature to deal with it and I know some people who are! Censored books are just a way to keep the way we live life quiet to some people and never let kids grow up and experience things.     We have a right to these books just like the people who write them have a right to do so. If they can publish them, then we should be able to read them no matter what our age is

Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple.     Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.     Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents.     Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is @PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out.     People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.     Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. @CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children

Reading is very important for kids these days. Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from. There are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days. There are exceptions to this however like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender. Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1-@CAPS2's.      Being a high school student and having a nice library in my school I have learned a lot from the books in my library. I have never in my @CAPS6 years of @CAPS4 seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them. I can assure you that there is not one book in the @CAPS7 that would offend me personally, this is not to say though that there are books out there that will offend certain people.     Reading books is fun to me and I would not want to miss out on a good book because a library is not holding it because there is the off chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book. Reading should not be limitted based on content because there is always someone out there who is looking for that certain book for a good read. I have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book. Seriously? An art book? Art is what it is. Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years. Why should it start to offend people now when it didnt offend people then? People are just weird in this day in age i guess.     There are certain movies that should most definately be removed from the shelves of libraries, such as porn for example. Porn should never, under no cercumstances be held in a library. There are special places for porn such as the internet. Music is a different story however. Music should not be taken out of libraries because there are some people who cannot affort to buy music for places like @LOCATION1, iTunes or @CAPS3. Music has so many genres that its is impossible to make out what should and shouldnt be in the library, and there are so many different types of people that listen to different types of music in the @CAPS7 and it would be wrong to tell that certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too rappy for the library. Listening to the music in the library is a different story however, you should definatly not be allowed to listen to your music in the library or at least not be allowed to have it loud enough for everyone else to hear it.     I dont read magazines but i know enough about them to know that they should and shouldnt be allowed into a library. Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' should definatly be allowed into a library because they are the hub of learning from magazines. However there are magazines that should not be allowed into a library like '@CAPS5' and other pornographic magazines as well as ones like '@CAPS6' which are magazines that target young girls to make them think that they should look perfect like the models in the pictures. Those are the types of magazines that make young girls dress skimpy and inapproprietly and make girls turn to throwing up to keep themselves skinny.     There are definatly some things that should be kept out of the libraries but one book, or one movie, or one genre of music, or one kind of magazine should not keep them all out. One problem shouldnt make them all a problem. Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 and other videogames. People should have the right to go to a labrary with the intent of getting something and they should be able to get what they came for.

What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today! There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc

@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree

I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.     In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded  the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work
<START>

Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work

Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violance and some nudety. This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says.     There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.       The nest thing is violance. Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. Because I have lost alot of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. People get these ideas because of movies.      Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. Now the kids know how to say them. Sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air.       My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs

Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them
<START>

I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc.      Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend.     Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive? Think about it... Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now?     Say your child is going to be reading '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? Depriving them of actual history? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate?     No. I wouldn't. I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history. I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries

Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages. Some @MONTH1 argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ. A library holds many books, magazines, movies, etc. that can advance the knowledge of citizens.      Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this. Instead, libraries should be divided into sections based on topics. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section.     How will children learn about what goes on in @LOCATION1 if they are not shown? Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early. This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting @PERSON2's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way.      Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason. What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy? This student should have no better source for information than a library. The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic.      These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well. If a library removes a biography on the rapper, @ORGANIZATION1, because he has a 'rocky past', they @MONTH1 lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today.      As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes throught the system, there @MONTH1 not be any books left to entertain ourselves. Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf.
<START>

There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved.      There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story.     I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship.     It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation.      Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries

Censorship, only for the light hearted.      We have had this issue for as long as man can remeber. Since we were only little kids to adults. Everything was censored. Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @NUM1k spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.      I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous. Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book. However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. I say its a library, let us read what we want to read.     Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book.      As far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie.      So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words. Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it. Thats all I have to say about censorship.

Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media

The libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in. They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive. Why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive. I know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive.     When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take. There are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it. There is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one. There is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject.     The way that i look at it is that you have two oppions. The frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books. The second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me. yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out. Well you want an answer and i will give you one. Those books mayne you don't want to read them. But what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it?     There for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library

Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2

There are many different perspetives on censorship in our country.  This is the human race, opinionative that is.  Different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children.  In libraries there are some reading materials, that some @MONTH1 find offensive.     Offensive material in libraries is @CAPS1 directed to be read by young children.  They are also @CAPS1 inteded to be able to get there hands on such material.  Even though this is @CAPS1 the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it.  No the material is @CAPS1 held under lock and key, but it is also @CAPS1 left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.     The problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books.  The material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories.  If we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.\     @CAPS1 all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be.  Some material @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be appropriate for children, but they also are @CAPS1 all inappropriate.  A rated '@NUM1' movie @MONTH1 be just like a rated '@CAPS2' movie only with one extra reference, that @MONTH1 be taken in the wrong way.  Even protective parents @MONTH1 allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.     Libraries should @CAPS1 remove this material from their shelves.  If it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library.  There are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children.  All of which do @CAPS1 have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.     Censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject.  There is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @CAPS1 to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries.  I believe it should @CAPS1 be taken off and there are alternatives to this.  This essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone
<START>

@STATE1 @NUM1, @PERSON1, IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson,                                            I read your article in newspaper yesterday about offensive books in library. I agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people.There can also be somw books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone have their own views and ideas on everything.The people of @LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something differrent to say.                       There are some books or movies that children can not read or watch but children still do because once the child is in library he can read,watch, or listen to anything. You can not depend on librarian because there are other people in the library too.The librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book.                       In my point of view, library should have diferent sections for different kinds of movies,books, or magazines and there should be person assigned for every section. This way children would not be able to go to older people's section. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to president to help remove those books from library.Yours @NUM2.
<START>

Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.     Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake.     I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.     Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as  self opinions?     In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?
<START>

I think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason. They might not know the reason so thats why i think it should because the person might get mad if you mess it up just cause you dont like it the way it is because it is offensive to some people. Other reasons is because people are gonna home and watch it online or on tv so how is it gonna make a difference. It is not goiing to make one difference at all.
<START>

No, I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people @MONTH1 find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new @CAPS1, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you don't its not their fault it's your fault.     Some people like stuff that others don't. Such as, stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion. But we can choose to read what ever you want to. If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting. Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff. If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in. Make it to were you have to show an @CAPS2 that says you are @NUM1 or older to get in. Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them. Than in order to check them out if you're under the age of @NUM1 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it. If it's a @CAPS1 or musican that has cussing in it you need to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent check @NUM4 out for you. Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music.      Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people @MONTH1 find inapproite. Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same. People are different like different things
<START>

Everyone in the world has different opinions. Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all. One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with eachother.     All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section. I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching abscene material; but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the innapropriate things sooner or later in school.      I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with innapropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much. They don't learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun.      Most parents agree that nothing innappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library. Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of @NUM1 cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch innappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It's as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much.      Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they're wanting to read. Let them read for @PERSON1's sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions.
<START>

I am writing this essay to you to tell you. That offensive books,music,movies,magazines,etc., Should not be on our library shelves. Because If are kids pick them up there will be @CAPS1, and crime. Some people mite ask how do I know this well say you see this cd cass that says black mans only cd. And a white boy picks it up well then a black kid sees it and that white boys hand the black guy will try to rip it out of his hand. Therefore starting a fight.
<START>

What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public. Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.     Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.     While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves.     I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.     I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.
<START>

In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older.     Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children. Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books. In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections.      When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'. They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys).         The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens. Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool.      Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries
<START>

@CAPS6 are many books out @CAPS6 that, if looked into, have something obsene or vulgar in it. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries.      Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar. @CAPS6 is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it @CAPS6 to fill in or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down. The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that @CAPS6 is no confusion or concern of the content of the book. You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will comprimise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken in to effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, The @PERSON1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't neccasary when a much simpler and more effective way to be accomplished.     Although offesive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content.

I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves. Just because i or any one else finds them offensive

I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.     And that is my view on this subject.

Books being taken off the shelves?  No way!  The @CAPS1 is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want.  Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else?  No, because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason.     Everybody is diffrent.  Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for diffrent types of information.  If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left.  What offends someone @MONTH1 not offend someone else.  For example, the libraries have information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history.  While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it, the information is also offending @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about.  But really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about.  It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to.     When people go to the @CAPS1 they know, no matter what information their looking for, they will find it.   Isn't that whats so great about trips to the @CAPS1?  Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason
<START>

Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?     I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.     Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it. Everyone has they're own oppenion, some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they're own way
<START>

I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, ect., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, ect., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos.          As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, ect., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true. Besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer.     In other words, the things that @MONTH1 offend one person @MONTH1 not offend another person. So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this.     According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, ect., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child. Books, music, movies, ect., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults.     In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, ect., that are found offensive by others @MONTH1 not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, ect., on the shelfs. If you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that @MONTH1 offend you, you would not be so offended. Also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can  be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner.

I dont think so becuase what if that is all the person likes to read.  They could put all the bookes in to diffrent sections so that littel kids wont be learning words they shouldnt know wright now.  the librarian could also make it where you have to be a sertaint age to cheak out a book.      There are a bunch of ways to orginze them in to sectoins like make a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. But i dont think the should take the out of the libary for good, becuse there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them. just becuase ther are some bad words in abook does not mean the book is bad

Keep it on the Shelf!     What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material.     Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.     Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store.     Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.     You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that @MONTH1 not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today.     Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material.

Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored?  Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them?  I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind.      Not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so.  I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow.  Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to.  If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child.  Some @MONTH1 say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so.  I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work.     If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none.  There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally.  The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will.   People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party.     I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi?  Created and controlled by the government surrounding him.  Made their slave through ignorance.  If in a society I  cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization.     In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents.  If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it @MONTH1 be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not read!  If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep

Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves.      First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today.      Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It @MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves.      Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive.      All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves

Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be  some type of censorship in libraires to protect the offended people . I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music. After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights.       Many authors , artist and musicans have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work ,a form of self expression. They do not publish their work to offend people , they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library.     Over many years most libraries have devloped and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This system seperates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instince if you are looking for a mystery book , you would find it in the non fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.      Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it  do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If everytime that happend there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.      In the end a book is a book , music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books of the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write , musicans play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything  it does not matter what is offensive to people , they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library

'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2'     @CAPS3 is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. @CAPS3 is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @MONTH1 be disturbing to certain people, but @CAPS3 does not mean that everyone finds @CAPS3 offenive.     Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project. The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found @CAPS3 disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @CAPS3 interesting. @CAPS3 was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me.     Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, @LOCATION1, found @CAPS3 disturbing to look at some pictures because @CAPS3 showed blood. Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While @PERSON1 found @CAPS3 disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @CAPS3 was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper.     I believe @CAPS3 is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @CAPS3. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource

I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.

Would you censor the @CAPS1? i @CAPS2 i sure would not. The @CAPS1 is a very percious and religoius part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousand of books, newpapers, articles, and media that play and important role in the history and the future of human beings.     Common sense or also referered as common knowledge is something that we dont pick up outa no where. We absoub it thought this that do, see, and read. An example is the 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5' this is a book of a @CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the @CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throught out the story the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk. but the @CAPS5 is happy. at the very end of the story they former young boy is now a old man that just wants a place to rest so the @CAPS5 straightens up his stumb and is just happy with @CAPS4 the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That @CAPS4 someone else happiness is the true gift of life.      Now relegion is something that is censored alot these day... Why?! The @CAPS1 for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Indivigle tha stories are just little reminders of right and wrong,  kindness and jelousy. Its doesnt say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night. its just helpfull advise, And really who has not asked someone else for advice? @CAPS8 relgion on tv, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we dont need relegion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a roman catholic and christian background have never really went to church or read the @CAPS1 am swelled up about relegion. Thanks to a close friend.     @CAPS8 could also be good at its points though. For an example @CAPS8 adult type content from minors is helpfull sence little kids dont @CAPS2 much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is @CAPS8 mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war.      so i will say that @CAPS8 can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as @CAPS8 relegious content, or @CAPS8 classical book that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be @CAPS10 by ages and ages to come!

Shut down libraries?     Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  Still, they put all of these things in the same building.  They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much.     However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  Make use of that thought I just told you.  I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life.  What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'?  Maybe THAT will give some education.     However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.  Your honor, I have my proof right here.  I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1.

With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them.     If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.     With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive. Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community
<START>

As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple variaties of books @MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one @MONTH1 choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some @MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde.     In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people @MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.      Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.     There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.

I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the the students would need that information to look up ideas that they would need to write about in a report or to right in a final. The reason the libary is here for the students to have and take there advantge to put time in to looking up what they need for their classes.knowing me I put the time that I need to do my work in class so i know what is need in the report so I know im doing it right and not just making up something that I could just stick in the report.   I see that it is imporant to keep the materials in the libary to have the convence to have thing that is needed to have to look  up a celebrity that is inporant to keep in touch with . If your writing in the news paper you are needed to the infomation that you  can get  your hands on to keep all the students informed in how there celebrity is living there live. If students are ready to graduate and there needing to go on line to look up type of colleges that they could attend before leaveing @ORGANIZATION1 so they could be prepard to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a live and acomplish thing that our parents didnt get to do.    The intrest of the libary to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read book that can show the situation on how your health benifits are by looking in the cancer book for information from how the sun and  going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by makeing your self look older by gettingas tanner.   I think the situation of the libary is to be use to  for our education and our benifits to learn more from book and reading it a lots interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a tv show or even movies that show all the action in a movie that you can get from a book with more details

It really don't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. But a  library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is devided up in sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person don't like it dont mean someone else dosn't.      Librarys don't make people look at or check out something they don't like. so why are people complaining about it. They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes over due. So people stop complainging about what the library has on there shelves.

In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books

What would you say if your library  was censored? Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library.     My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.      The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area.     The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You @MONTH1 please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action.     Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into section by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.      With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library

Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials.     Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things.     Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of @LOCATION2, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events.     Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold

I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others

Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice. However, if a library decides to remove every  piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare.          I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone @MONTH1 find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right.           There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be disturbing because of how graffic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you.       With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something. Religious groups @MONTH1 be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders @MONTH1 be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive.      If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you @MONTH1 bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots @MONTH1 teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it.  As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them.

Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?

As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.

I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library.  Libraries are meant to provide people with the varities of media that they need.  This action will pose three things: business loss, inconvenience, and a narrowing of people's book selections.     The first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business.  Just like any other industry, libraries need people to use their multimedia materials, such as: books, magazines, music, etc. so they stay in business.  The purpose many people go to the library is to get certain magazines, or movies, and so forth, and to get rid of certain movies and/or magazines is getting rid of certain cuatomers.  Another reason is the loss of business will lead to loss in customers, and if there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will be closed down.  No one wants their library to be closed, so libraries should not be censored.     Also, parents, instead of having an entire library censored, censor what  children get from libraries.  One way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children.  For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to check-out a movie that is rated @CAPS1 they would not be able to.The restriction on their card could be to rated @CAPS2, or @NUM1 movies.  Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library.  For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to get @NUM1 movies,  only allow them to get like one at a time.  This will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian.     Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries.  One reason is that out of all the books in the library, i'm sure at least one person is offened by each one.  Does this mean that every library should close its doors?  No, of course not, this just means that if something offends someone from their  local library, stay away from it.  Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc.  A second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to people's beliefs or religion.  Libraries offer many things to help people in enriching their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored.     Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person, is essential to another.  In every book of every library their is something that people most likely think should be censored.  But they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously.  Those same books transform lives, and are read to improve their understanding of something.  So never will I think that the library should be censored.
<START>

Freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose.  Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library.  Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well.     First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults.  Eighteen year olds can go into rated @CAPS1 movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely.  In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom.  For example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages.  So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries.  Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference.     Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely.  For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read.  If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents @MONTH1 want the child to read whatever he/she choses to.  If their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses.  The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child.     Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book.  For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say.  People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said.  Also there is the television.  The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to.  Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight.  These things offend people every day.  Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book.     In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children.  Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want.  Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves.  Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive.  If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out!  Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.

These days there are many kinds of merdia in the liberaries beside books. There are musics, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from liberaries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't remove. Even it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the informations are going to removed. After all, nothings is going to be leaft.     There are a lot of imfornation in this world. Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, book and from other medias. Parent want to let their children to learn much as possible. However there are sutten things that parent doesn't want the children to learn. You need to think this way. That children will grow up and become adult, then they will know any way. Why would you move from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how? What is a point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves helps children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that.     Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a books that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. I agree with Katherine. Once, the books or other mediea get removed because of some reason, other things are going to removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be remove, like Katherine said there are nothing gonna leaft for the children. If nothing gonna leaft for the children what is main point of having libaries?     I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adualt. Also there is nothing gonna leaft for the children in the libareries

Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things.

The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries. If you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located.     Books are ment to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book loving person in this world. There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up to dabate. Personally, I believe the childrens books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate.     Teenage reading material should be seperate from both childrens books and adult reading material. In this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive.     Books that some people find offensive should be catigorized, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. They should also be catigorized as '@CAPS3', '@CAPS4', or 'Other'. In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and @MONTH1 be offended, @CAPS5 is manditory that we do our best to limit those times. All necissary precautions should be taken.      At the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece @CAPS2 or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from @CAPS2 to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize @CAPS5 or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books.     I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. At the same time I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of @CAPS2, past thoughts, and past expeiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they @MONTH1 be found inappropriate.

I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expresion off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have there own chocies, we shouldn't limit them.It's all about making chocies in life, people should get the right to read the books,magaizes, ect they want, With out people looking down on them or thinking the material they receve is unatural. What one person @MONTH1 think is not good read the next person might think the total oppoiste.     Music is a creative aspest in our world, @CAPS1 person you meet are not the same so @CAPS3 should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it's comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyones elses will. If that was the case then the world would be one boreding place to live in. I think that @CAPS1 one has there on taste in music. If your the right age and your not hurting anybody, Then whats the big problem listing to the music that incourge you to become creative.      There are alot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for there kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what there doing. I think that @CAPS1 movie you watch has a sercet point in it, In other words the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2. I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, We shold be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.               The children in the world are going to have to make there own chocies and what they find intresing, @CAPS3 should we band everything we thinks thats not. We need you let the children grow on there own and aslo learn on there own. Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to.     In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the chocie there want.The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it

When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at. It can be offensive. I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies,magazines, should be removed from from shelves if they are found offensive. No i dont believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. Many kids today are into gang realted activites because they see parents,older siblings, or even friends into so they decide to do the same because they feel its cool.    Teens now days really dont care the movies, or the music. Not all music or movies are offensive. So we cant blame that. We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies listen to uncut music. We choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies. The people who make their uncut music or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies dont care who watches it or what affects it would have on children and neither does the parents. They're just trying to make a living like everyone else.      If parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place. Just because some say that offensive movies, music or even magazines should be removed doesnt mean its there fault. Its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies
<START>

I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want.     Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 like it. Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf; and act like you never picked it up.
<START>

I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like.
<START>

One of the amendements in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is freedom of speech, this amendment gives the freedom of speech to anyone who has something to say, as long as what they have to say does not interfere with the @CAPS2 of others. It has been long since passed that the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was signed, but even today there are questions on the subject that still remain; should people be allowed to censor books? This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans, and has been the a topic of great contraversy for many years.     Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they @MONTH1 see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they dispised, there would not be any books left in the world. In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethinicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the @LOCATION1, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task.     We on @LOCATION1 live in a very diverse society, and liturature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy. The way of life that one lives @MONTH1 be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as liturature has. It is like being in school, there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class see as really different. Our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same.     Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate. This is becuase everyone is different, and has their own opinions. Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living. However the issue will go on, because after all we are all different and have our own opinions.
<START>

I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.
<START>

I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world and they should know it. That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about. That will be all

I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries. That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide whats right for them.          Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines. With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it.     Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it. It @MONTH1 make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it. It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person @MONTH1 find immoral and wrong someone else @MONTH1 be able to learn from it some how. If you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone.           Our media is very powerful and should not be censored. Media has an unbelieveable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it. We have not even seen half of what media can do
<START>

Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' @CAPS1 of all, she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this. There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definately, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things.     Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing.     Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhor. Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely.     Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate.     In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced. Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.
<START>

I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you.      It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves?      Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.
<START>

Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this
<START>

Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life.

Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.      Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real @CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2.      Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so.      Everyone is different. The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful @CAPS2. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do

There a books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont.     I dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. That doesnt make any sence at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.

I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usualy get movies or music. If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school.     I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that. For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's there choice to read it not mine.     It's like the radio know. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words. I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words. The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words. To me I don't think thats right. It's also like telivtion now. You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them. When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge.     To me I think every thing should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio. Theres no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way. I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax

It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.

People will always take things offensive.  It is a fact of life.  No one will ever be completly satisified no matter what.  We can not try to please everyone, but it will never happen.  We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others.  Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is veiwed either.  The same should go for a library.     I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate.  Some of the things authors write can be either innapproraite or offensive.  That is their freedom of speech.  We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the apprearance of books.  For music and movies they usually have a warning lable if it is not intended for younger kids.  It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines.      In order to see a rated, '@CAPS1', movie you have to be over @NUM1 and for a good reason because of the mature content.  The books being writen now are more and more mature.  But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invaid the privacy of others.     No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive.  Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owened and therefore have no one owner.  The city owns them.  If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision.  Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unnanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves.  The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request.      Taking books off the shelves I beleive is taking away from the public's ability to read.  If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian.  The librarian @MONTH1 be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and apealing to their child.

There are alot of things that people think do do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be tooken down. I think that if there is somthimg foumd offincive in a library, it should be tooken down immediatley.     Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books not a place were if we find somthing disturbing or offensive we shouldnt come there any more. Some people might not care about the things they see and some do. Therefore if i see somthing that offends me and is disturbing to me i will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files.     Now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it @MONTH1 be offends you in the library, then i believe it should be removed from that library. If people find things less attracctive and offensive it will soon go around and less people will come to that library. This is how i put it, make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading there book, magazine, etc., not for you. It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think

This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries. Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library.      Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all.       There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't.     So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around.

Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved

Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect.      First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.     Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. @CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am.     Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay.       Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.

Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.      If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.      Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.      When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.     These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else

The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day.      Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors.     Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @LOCATION1 function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves.     I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept.      Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @LOCATION2 has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option.      I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries

Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad.      Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years.     Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day.      Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing.      In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about.

I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library.     Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety  to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves.     Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict.     No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to

Libraries            @CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies. Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere. Just think @CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately. If you'd like to rent them you @MONTH1 ask for assistance, and go from @CAPS1. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information.  In my own perspective @CAPS1 should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, @MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it. Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people @MONTH1 be turned away and your library @MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies? An empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at. Taking away such materials @MONTH1 cause alot of grief. Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and @CAPS1 will be no complications

Good? Bad? Offensive or not? These are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. Who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     From things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @MONTH1 express what they feel on a given topic. Though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. In society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. Whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      In society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. The world will never be perfect! The only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @MONTH1 ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. If one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      At the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. It will briefly tell you that there is some content they @MONTH1 not be appropriate, that @MONTH1 hurt feelings, and simply offend. It is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      Every human is entitled to freedom of speech. This doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. There are words spoken that will offend many! From @PERSON1 using racial slurs in speeches, to @LOCATION1 calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      People will always be offended. There are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. Not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. From ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. Everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. We are all special; and we all think differently. We find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @MONTH1 not.      @NUM1 years ago when i was in @NUM2 grade, my @CAPS1 class was reading a story about the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. There were @CAPS4 young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. Times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @LOCATION2. As my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. After the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. Five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. In the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. In less than @MONEY1, @NUM3 blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. This teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' wasn't censored in any way. Though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. Because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      I've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. There will always be at least @NUM4 person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. In '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', the book wasn't censored, but I still believe that it should stay on library shelves. That book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. By keeping the harsh language, I feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that I feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. For all of these reasons, I proudly say that I believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves

When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audiences interest and they will go eslewhere. Now that doesnt mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why.     There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity, and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such needs to have conditions.Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore would'nt be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were availible only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem.     Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes books they can be placed in areas availible to epople who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies is a form of entertainment that is strongly advertsied over magazines and books. Any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was inteded for.      If @CAPS1 wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well. @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be seperated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appualing. Listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isnt preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone headphones should be a requirement. The library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless. This can potentially eleminate the problem as long as the headphones themsleves are at an appropriate level. If @CAPS1 want to check out any materials that is or can be offensive or explicit in some way  they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being availible to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1.     In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children this can eleminate the issue. Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume. No items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced. With rules and conditions the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.

I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the libary. Honestly thats where a lot of people go and find other music, yes it could be offinsive to some people, but to others its not. They have the right to say they dont want to listen to that stuff, so they dont have to. The libary holds over a @NUM1 different kinds of music, movies,magazines, ect. So if theres over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear , and look at?     The libary is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting. Why would they put it in there just to take it all away. I remember going to the libary as a young child and looking around me, i saw all these other people look at things i have never even heard of, granted i was only @NUM2, but my point is that, people grow into what they like, they arent just born liking something and thats it.       I think the library is perfect just the way it is. I think that if anything we should put more differnet kinds of music. I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you wantt o force them to? I think that the @CAPS1.S is populating more and more everyday, that all we can do is just extend it in every way posible.     Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books, they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting. I know im a person that would much rather watch a movie, or listen to music than read a book.Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to trea them that way.     Being @NUM3, and if i had to listen to disney tracks all the time, i think i would drive myself crazy. I listen to the things i listen to because i have interest in them, if somebody took away my music away i wouldnt know what to do with myself. I guess i would just have to readthe books i dont like, and listen to the music i cant stand.     The music should stay in the libraries because thats where it belongs, you cant make everybody happy

In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?
<START>

I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section
